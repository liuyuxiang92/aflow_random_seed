                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE \n\
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007 \n\
 \n\
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies \n\
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. \n\
 \n\
                            Preamble \n\
 \n\
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for \n\
software and other kinds of works. \n\
 \n\
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed \n\
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, \n\
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to \n\
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free \n\
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the \n\
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to \n\
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to \n\
your programs, too. \n\
 \n\
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not \n\
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you \n\
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for \n\
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you \n\
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new \n\
free programs, and that you know you can do these things. \n\
 \n\
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you \n\
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have \n\
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if \n\
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. \n\
 \n\
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether \n\
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same \n\
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive \n\
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they \n\
know their rights. \n\
 \n\
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: \n\
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License \n\
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. \n\
 \n\
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains \n\
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and \n\
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as \n\
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to \n\
authors of previous versions. \n\
 \n\
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run \n\
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer \n\
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of \n\
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic \n\
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to \n\
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we \n\
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those \n\
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we \n\
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions \n\
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. \n\
 \n\
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. \n\
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of \n\
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to \n\
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could \n\
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that \n\
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. \n\
 \n\
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and \n\
modification follow. \n\
 \n\
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS \n\
 \n\
  0. Definitions. \n\
 \n\
  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. \n\
 \n\
  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of \n\
works, such as semiconductor masks. \n\
 \n\
  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this \n\
License.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and \n\
\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations. \n\
 \n\
  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work \n\
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an \n\
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the \n\
earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work. \n\
 \n\
  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based \n\
on the Program. \n\
 \n\
  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without \n\
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for \n\
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a \n\
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, \n\
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the \n\
public, and in some countries other activities as well. \n\
 \n\
  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other \n\
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through \n\
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. \n\
 \n\
  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" \n\
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible \n\
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) \n\
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the \n\
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the \n\
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If \n\
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a \n\
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. \n\
 \n\
  1. Source Code. \n\
 \n\
  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work \n\
for making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source \n\
form of a work. \n\
 \n\
  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official \n\
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of \n\
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that \n\
is widely used among developers working in that language. \n\
 \n\
  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other \n\
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of \n\
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major \n\
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that \n\
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an \n\
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A \n\
\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component \n\
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system \n\
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to \n\
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. \n\
 \n\
  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all \n\
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable \n\
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to \n\
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's \n\
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free \n\
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but \n\
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source \n\
includes interface definition files associated with source files for \n\
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically \n\
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, \n\
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those \n\
subprograms and other parts of the work. \n\
 \n\
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users \n\
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding \n\
Source. \n\
 \n\
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that \n\
same work. \n\
 \n\
  2. Basic Permissions. \n\
 \n\
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of \n\
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated \n\
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited \n\
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a \n\
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its \n\
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your \n\
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. \n\
 \n\
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not \n\
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains \n\
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose \n\
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you \n\
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with \n\
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do \n\
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works \n\
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction \n\
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of \n\
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. \n\
 \n\
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under \n\
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 \n\
makes it unnecessary. \n\
 \n\
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. \n\
 \n\
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological \n\
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article \n\
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or \n\
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such \n\
measures. \n\
 \n\
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid \n\
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention \n\
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to \n\
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or \n\
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's \n\
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of \n\
technological measures. \n\
 \n\
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. \n\
 \n\
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you \n\
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and \n\
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; \n\
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any \n\
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; \n\
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all \n\
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. \n\
 \n\
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, \n\
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. \n\
 \n\
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. \n\
 \n\
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to \n\
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the \n\
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: \n\
 \n\
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified \n\
    it, and giving a relevant date. \n\
 \n\
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is \n\
    released under this License and any conditions added under section \n\
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \n\
    \"keep intact all notices\". \n\
 \n\
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this \n\
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This \n\
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 \n\
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, \n\
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no \n\
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not \n\
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. \n\
 \n\
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display \n\
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive \n\
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your \n\
    work need not make them do so. \n\
 \n\
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent \n\
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, \n\
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, \n\
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \n\
\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not \n\
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users \n\
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work \n\
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other \n\
parts of the aggregate. \n\
 \n\
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. \n\
 \n\
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms \n\
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the \n\
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, \n\
in one of these ways: \n\
 \n\
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product \n\
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the \n\
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium \n\
    customarily used for software interchange. \n\
 \n\
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product \n\
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a \n\
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as \n\
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product \n\
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a \n\
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the \n\
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical \n\
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no \n\
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this \n\
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the \n\
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. \n\
 \n\
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the \n\
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This \n\
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and \n\
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord \n\
    with subsection 6b. \n\
 \n\
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated \n\
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the \n\
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no \n\
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the \n\
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to \n\
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source \n\
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) \n\
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain \n\
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the \n\
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the \n\
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is \n\
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. \n\
 \n\
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided \n\
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding \n\
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no \n\
    charge under subsection 6d. \n\
 \n\
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded \n\
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be \n\
included in conveying the object code work. \n\
 \n\
  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any \n\
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, \n\
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation \n\
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product, \n\
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular \n\
product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a \n\
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status \n\
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user \n\
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product \n\
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial \n\
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent \n\
the only significant mode of use of the product. \n\
 \n\
  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, \n\
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install \n\
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from \n\
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must \n\
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object \n\
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because \n\
modification has been made. \n\
 \n\
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or \n\
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as \n\
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the \n\
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a \n\
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the \n\
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied \n\
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply \n\
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install \n\
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has \n\
been installed in ROM). \n\
 \n\
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a \n\
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates \n\
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for \n\
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a \n\
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and \n\
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and \n\
protocols for communication across the network. \n\
 \n\
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, \n\
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly \n\
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in \n\
source code form), and must require no special password or key for \n\
unpacking, reading or copying. \n\
 \n\
  7. Additional Terms. \n\
 \n\
  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this \n\
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. \n\
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall \n\
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent \n\
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions \n\
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately \n\
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by \n\
this License without regard to the additional permissions. \n\
 \n\
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option \n\
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of \n\
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own \n\
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place \n\
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, \n\
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. \n\
 \n\
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you \n\
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of \n\
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: \n\
 \n\
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the \n\
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or \n\
 \n\
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or \n\
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal \n\
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or \n\
 \n\
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or \n\
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in \n\
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or \n\
 \n\
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or \n\
    authors of the material; or \n\
 \n\
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some \n\
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or \n\
 \n\
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that \n\
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of \n\
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for \n\
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on \n\
    those licensors and authors. \n\
 \n\
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further \n\
restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you \n\
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is \n\
governed by this License along with a term that is a further \n\
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains \n\
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this \n\
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms \n\
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does \n\
not survive such relicensing or conveying. \n\
 \n\
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you \n\
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the \n\
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating \n\
where to find the applicable terms. \n\
 \n\
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the \n\
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; \n\
the above requirements apply either way. \n\
 \n\
  8. Termination. \n\
 \n\
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly \n\
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or \n\
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under \n\
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third \n\
paragraph of section 11). \n\
 \n\
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your \n\
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) \n\
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and \n\
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright \n\
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means \n\
prior to 60 days after the cessation. \n\
 \n\
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is \n\
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the \n\
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have \n\
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that \n\
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after \n\
your receipt of the notice. \n\
 \n\
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the \n\
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under \n\
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently \n\
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same \n\
material under section 10. \n\
 \n\
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. \n\
 \n\
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or \n\
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work \n\
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission \n\
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, \n\
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or \n\
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do \n\
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a \n\
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. \n\
 \n\
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. \n\
 \n\
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically \n\
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and \n\
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible \n\
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. \n\
 \n\
  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an \n\
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an \n\
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered \n\
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that \n\
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever \n\
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could \n\
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the \n\
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if \n\
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. \n\
 \n\
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the \n\
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may \n\
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of \n\
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation \n\
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that \n\
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for \n\
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. \n\
 \n\
  11. Patents. \n\
 \n\
  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this \n\
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The \n\
work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\". \n\
 \n\
  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims \n\
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or \n\
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted \n\
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, \n\
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a \n\
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For \n\
purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant \n\
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of \n\
this License. \n\
 \n\
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free \n\
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to \n\
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and \n\
propagate the contents of its contributor version. \n\
 \n\
  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express \n\
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent \n\
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to \n\
sue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a \n\
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a \n\
patent against the party. \n\
 \n\
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, \n\
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone \n\
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a \n\
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, \n\
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so \n\
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the \n\
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner \n\
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent \n\
license to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have \n\
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the \n\
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work \n\
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that \n\
country that you have reason to believe are valid. \n\
 \n\
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or \n\
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a \n\
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties \n\
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify \n\
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license \n\
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered \n\
work and works based on it. \n\
 \n\
  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within \n\
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is \n\
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are \n\
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered \n\
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is \n\
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment \n\
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying \n\
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the \n\
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory \n\
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work \n\
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily \n\
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that \n\
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, \n\
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. \n\
 \n\
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting \n\
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may \n\
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. \n\
 \n\
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom. \n\
 \n\
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or \n\
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not \n\
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a \n\
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this \n\
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may \n\
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you \n\
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey \n\
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this \n\
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. \n\
 \n\
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. \n\
 \n\
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have \n\
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed \n\
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single \n\
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this \n\
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, \n\
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, \n\
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the \n\
combination as such. \n\
 \n\
  14. Revised Versions of this License. \n\
 \n\
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of \n\
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will \n\
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to \n\
address new problems or concerns. \n\
 \n\
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the \n\
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General \n\
Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the \n\
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered \n\
version or of any later version published by the Free Software \n\
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the \n\
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published \n\
by the Free Software Foundation. \n\
 \n\
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future \n\
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's \n\
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you \n\
to choose that version for the Program. \n\
 \n\
  Later license versions may give you additional or different \n\
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any \n\
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a \n\
later version. \n\
 \n\
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty. \n\
 \n\
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY \n\
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT \n\
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY \n\
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, \n\
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR \n\
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM \n\
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF \n\
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. \n\
 \n\
  16. Limitation of Liability. \n\
 \n\
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING \n\
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS \n\
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY \n\
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE \n\
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF \n\
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD \n\
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), \n\
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF \n\
SUCH DAMAGES. \n\
 \n\
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. \n\
 \n\
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided \n\
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, \n\
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates \n\
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the \n\
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a \n\
copy of the Program in return for a fee. \n\
 \n\
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS \n\
 \n\
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs \n\
 \n\
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest \n\
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it \n\
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. \n\
 \n\
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest \n\
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively \n\
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least \n\
the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. \n\
 \n\
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> \n\
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author> \n\
 \n\
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify \n\
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by \n\
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or \n\
    (at your option) any later version. \n\
 \n\
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, \n\
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of \n\
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the \n\
    GNU General Public License for more details. \n\
 \n\
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License \n\
 \n\
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. \n\
 \n\
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short \n\
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode: \n\
 \n\
    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author> \n\
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. \n\
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it \n\
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details. \n\
 \n\
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate \n\
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands \n\
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\". \n\
 \n\
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, \n\
if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. \n\
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see \n\
 \n\
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program \n\
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you \n\
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with \n\
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General \n\
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read \n\

   --np=NUMBER  With MPI=ON (option or supercomputer defaults) \n\
                aflow uses NUMBER as parameter for the MPI run. \n\
                This declaration overrides the [AFLOW_MODE_MPI_MODE]NCPUS=XX  \n\
                statement in the aflow.in file. \n\
 \n\
                With MPI=OFF \n\
                aflow starts a NUMBER number of concurrent threaded runs within \n\
                the \"loop\" search (--DIRECTORY=..) or the \"file\" table list (--FILE=..). \n\
                For the multithread start, you have to enable multi. \n\
                Examples: \n\
                aflow --multi --np=32 --DIRECTORY=./ICSD_POOL \n\
                aflow --multi --np=24 --FILE=./jobs2run \n\
 \n\
                With aconvasp. \n\
                Some parts of aflow are multithreaded. If you specify \n\
                --np=NUMBER, a NUMBER of independent threads will be \n\
                launched to perform the task in a multitasking fashion. \n\
 \n\
   --npmax      With this option, aflow starts a number of concurrent runs \n\
                equal to the maximun numbers of processors. \n\
 \n\
   --multish    Very useful option for scripting. \n\
                if you have a \"file\" containing a gazillion of instructions, \n\
                one per line, such as \n\
                command_perform ./directory1 \n\
                command_perform ./directory2 \n\
                ...... \n\
                command_perform ./directory.. \n\
                then the instruction \n\
                aflow --multish --np=XX --FILE file \n\
                will pipe the instruction in a push-pop list and feed XX cpus in a \n\
                multithreaded environment. You can susbtitute \"--np=XX\" with \"--npmax\" \n\
                (or omit it at all) and use the max number of available cores in the \n\
                machine. Instead of --FILE you can use \" --F | -F | --f | -f\". \n\
                If you omit the --FILE option, then the last argument will \n\
                be taken as the name of the file. \n\
                Note that due to the variable nature of the time requested for each line, \n\
                you might loose causality in the whole process (most of the times \n\
                you do not need it, though). \n\
                These are examples of proper commands: \n\
                aflow --multish --np=12 --FILE file   (run file in 12 cores) \n\
                aflow --multish --np=12 file          (run file in 12 cores) \n\
                aflow --multish file                  (run file in all your cores) \n\
 \n\
   --multizip   Very useful option for scripting. \n\
                aflow --multizip [--prefix=PREFIX] [--size=SSSS] [--add] --F file | -D directory1 directory2 .... \n\
                if you have a huge amount of directories to zip then you can clusterize them, so that \n\
                each subzip contains no more than SSSS entries. \n\
                The \"prefix=\" is optional, the default is \"m\" \n\
                The \"size=\" is optional, the default is 100. \n\
                If you add  --add then, if zips are present, they will be added with the new files. \n\
                This is a very useful option because many file systems do not allow big files. \n\
                I usually use: \n\
                aflow --multizip --prefix=magnetic --size=500 `find . -name EIGENVAL.bands.bz2` \n\
                To make life easier, this option clears up the words \n\
                \"LOCK,aflow.in,OUTCAR.relax2.bz2,EIGENVAL.bands.bz2\" from the directory names. \n\
 \n\
   --multibzip2 Very useful option for scripting. \n\
                aflow --multibzip2 --np=XX --FILE file file2 file3.... \n\
                if you have a huge amount of files to bzip2 then you can multithread the bzip2 so there are XX (np) cores doing it concurrently. \n\
                If --np=is not specified then the code will take 1 core. \n\
                The filenames with \".bz2\" extension are neglected. \n\
   --multibunzip2 Very useful option for scripting. \n\
                aflow --multibunzip2 --np=XX --FILE file.bz2 file2.bz2 file3.bz2.... \n\
                Same as --multibzip2 but for un-bzipping. \n\
                The filenames without \".bz2\" extension are neglected. \n\
   --multigzip Very useful option for scripting. \n\
                aflow --multigzip --np=XX --FILE file file2 file3.... \n\
                if you have a huge amount of files to gzip then you can multithread the gzip so there are XX (np) cores doing it concurrently. \n\
                If --np=is not specified then the code will take 1 core. \n\
                The filenames with \".gz\" extension are neglected. \n\
   --multibunzip Very useful option for scripting. \n\
                aflow --multibunzip --np=XX --FILE file.gz file2.gz file3.gz.... \n\
                Same as --multigzip but for un-gzipping. \n\
                The filenames without \".gz\" extension are neglected. \n\
   --multixzip Very useful option for scripting. \n\
                aflow --multixzip --np=XX --FILE file file2 file3.... \n\
                if you have a huge amount of files to xzip then you can multithread the xzip so there are XX (np) cores doing it concurrently. \n\
                If --np=is not specified then the code will take 1 core. \n\
                The filenames with \".xz\" extension are neglected. \n\
   --multibunzip Very useful option for scripting. \n\
                aflow --multibunzip --np=XX --FILE file.xz file2.xz file3.xz.... \n\
                Same as --multixzip but for un-xzipping. \n\
                The filenames without \".xz\" extension are neglected. \n\
 \n\
   --getTEMP [--runstat | --runbar | --refresh=X | --warning_beep=T | --warning_halt=T | --mem=XX ] \n\
                If available, the command outputs the hostname and temperatures of the machine. Useful to find hardware issues: \n\
                with --runstat the command continuously prints the temperature, refreshing every XX refresh seconds; \n\
                with --runbar the command prints a bar with the temperature, refreshing every XX refresh seconds; \n\
                with --refresh=X you can specify the refresh time (DEFAULT below) \n\
                with --warning_beep=T, if the max temp goes beyond T(C, DEFAULT below), the command beeps the computer speaker; \n\
                with --warning_halt=T, it the max temp goes beyond T(C, DEFAULT below), the command halts the computer (aconvasp must be run as root). \n\
		with --max==X | --maxmem=XX, it kills vasp/mpivasp using more than XX% of memory. \n\
                DEFAULT VALUES in .aflow.rc \n\
 \n\
   --monitor [--mem=XX] \n\
                This is a wrap up set of commands to be sent in the background so that the node is monitored for health/ \n\
                It kills vasp/mpivasp using more than XX% of memory. \n\
		The default for XX is 95%/NCPUs, so even in the worst scenario there shoud be enough RAM to resuscitate \n\
                a soon-to-be-frozen machine/node. \n\
 \n\
   --generate_aflowin_from_vasp \n\
       ACTION:  Generates aflow.in from xCARs \n\
       NOTE1:   You can add extra parameters to aflow.in by using \n\
                --set \"[KEYWORD]\", where the keyword is one \n\
                of the specified below. You can add as many as you want. \n\
                Be careful: there is no check for inconsistency. \n\
       NOTE2:   You can remove VASP files after the generation with the \n\
                option --delete_xcars (remove all except aflow.in). \n\
 \n\
   --generate_vasp_from_aflowin | --generate \n\
       ACTION:  Generates xCARs from aflow.in \n\
       NOTE:    This option does not run any simulation. \n\

********************************************************************************* \n\
aflow.in \n\
 \n\
Aflow/aflowd reads lines starting with \"[xxxx..\" where xxx \n\
is the command. If you put a character between \"[\" and \"xxxx\" like \n\
\"[!xxxx\" the line is ignored. If you add a \"#\" at the beginning of a line \n\
(such as \"#[xxx\"), everything on the left of # is ignored by aflow as \n\
command/string/parameter (ignored by aflow does not mean ignored by the \n\
binary code!). These features are useful if you want to generate a lot of \n\
similar aflow.in's and you want to add/remove options in a very short time. \n\
 \n\
 \n\
[AFLOW]				OPTIONAL \n\
 everything on the left contains comments \n\

 Compression of output files at the end. You can write whatever \n\
 you want as long as \"command\" is recognized. \n\
 I suggest: \n\
 [AFLOW_MODE_ZIP=none] does not compress \n\
 [AFLOW_MODE_ZIP=xz] \n\
 [AFLOW_MODE_ZIP=gzip] \n\
 [AFLOW_MODE_ZIP=xz] \n\
 \n\
[AFLOW_MODE_BINARY=****] or [AFLOW_MODE_BINARY]**** OPTIONAL, Default in .aflow.rc \n\
 the binary you want to start in each directory. If you put ./xxx \n\
 you would start the exact binary in such directory. \n\
 In MODE_VASP the default is vasp46s \n\
 \n\
[AFLOW_MODE_PRESCRIPT]                                OPTIONAL \n\
 Execute everything after the keywords [AFLOW_MODE_PRESCRIPT] \n\
 as a script BEFORE executing the AFLOW_MODE_BINARY simulations. \n\
 The output of the script is piped into the aflow.prescript.out file. \n\
 You need to watch for syntax and be careful with the commands. \n\
 The script can also be contained between \n\
  [AFLOW_MODE_PRESCRIPT]START \n\
  script \n\
  [AFLOW_MODE_PRESCRIPT]STOP \n\
 \n\
[AFLOW_MODE_POSTSCRIPT]                              OPTIONAL \n\
 Execute everything after the keywords [AFLOW_MODE_POSTSCRIPT] \n\
 as a script AFTER executing the AFLOW_MODE_BINARY simulations. \n\
 The output of the script is piped into the aflow.postscript.out file. \n\
 You need to watch for syntax and be careful with the commands. \n\
 The script can also be contained between \n\
  [AFLOW_MODE_POSTSCRIPT]START \n\
  script \n\
  [AFLOW_MODE_POSTSCRIPT]STOP \n\
 \n\
[AFLOW_MODE_EMAIL] or [AFLOW_MODE]EMAIL	              OPTIONAL \n\
 Email the recipient address specified after the keyword \n\
 [AFLOW_MODE_EMAIL] the output of the LOCK file once the \n\
 prescript, simulations and postscripts are execute. \n\
 WARNING: This keyword is not implemented yet. \n\

  With this option, AFLOW takes the mpirun commands as specified in aflow_aflowr.cpp for this machine. \n\
  MPI_COMMAND_XXXXXXX,  MPI_BINARY_DIR_XXXXXXX, sets up the AUTOTUNE (start,stop are neglected) \n\
  and overrides the NCPUS value specified with the option --np=NUMBER (if specified) \n\
 \n\
******************************************************************************** \n\
 \n\
[AFLOW_MODE_MPI]                OPTIONAL, default NONE \n\
 Turns ON MPI parallel execution. Aflow will neglect the \n\
 serial AFLOW_MODE_BINARY=binary. \n\
 The computer should have already all the files to run \n\
 mpi executables, such as hosts/.rhost/ etcetera. \n\
 \n\
[AFLOW_MODE_MPI_MODE]KEYWORD    OPTIONAL \n\
 Keyword to specify parameters. After [AFLOW_MODE_MPI_MODE] you \n\
 can put \n\
 NCPUS=NNN           OPTIONAL, default NNN=4 \n\
  With NCPUS=0 or NCPUS=MAX aflow will try to guess the \n\
  maximum number of cpus of the system by performing and \n\
  analyzing the file /proc/cpuinfo as described in the note. \n\
  With NNN=1 aflow will revert to SERIAL execution wih the \n\
  AFLOW_MODE_BINARY=binary. \n\
  Note: NCPUS=MAX goets through execution of the logical \n\
  command `cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep -c \"cpu MHz\"`. It works \n\
  on Linux installations with 2.6+ kernels. In case of troubles \n\
  the default is _MPI_NCPUS_DEF_=4 specified in aflow_aflowrc.cpp. \n\
  This is good for old alphas (I have a beautiful Alpha ES45 \n\
  with 4 CPUS. Stefano). \n\
 START=\"string\"      OPTIONAL, default \"\" \n\
  The command you have to perform to start the mpi daemon. \n\
  For LAM you have to execute \"lamboot\". For mpich1 or mpich2 \n\
  you have to specify something else. \n\
 STOP=\"string\"       OPTIONAL, default \"\" \n\
  The command you have to perform to stop the mpi daemon. \n\
  For LAM you have to execute \"lamhalt\". For mpich1 or mpich2 \n\
  you have to specify something else. \n\
 COMMAND=\"string\"    OPTIONAL, default \"mpirun -np\" \n\
  The command you have to perform to execute the mpi executable. \n\
  Usually it is \"mpirun\" but in some computers with multiple \n\
  installations you might need to specify something else. \n\
 AUTOTUNE            OPTIONAL \n\
  If set, then aflow will neglect the PARALLEL MPI parameters \n\
  in the input file and ajust them following the instructions \n\
  of the code you are using. \n\
  Note: this flag is currently used only for VASP and tunes \n\
  LPLANE,NPAR,IALGO,LSCALU,NSIM as specified in the VASP manual \n\
  for Linux Clusters. \n\
 BINARY=\"string\"     OPTIONAL, default \"mpivasp46s\" \n\
  Specifies the mpi executable you are trying to run. \n\
 \n\
******************************************************************************** \n\
[AFLOW_MODE_QSUB]                OPTIONAL, default NONE \n\
 Turns ON qsub (or other queue) systems. Aflow will go inside \n\
 the directory and produce a file, \"aflow.qsub.run\", \n\
 as described below. \n\
 The file MUST organize the queue batch script and, at the \n\
 end, should contain 'echo \"DONE\" > aflow.qsub.done'. \n\
 Once the queue is submitted, the file \"aflow.qsub.done\" is \n\
 checked every few minutes, until the string DONE is found and \n\
 the simulation is considered finished. Check out the example \n\
 below. \n\
 \n\
 [AFLOW_QSUB_MODE_**PLICIT]     MANDATORY, no default \n\
  Only the EXPLICIT mode of QSUB is supported. Everything on \n\
  the left of \"[AFLOW_QSUB_FILE]\" strings is copied into QSUB files. \n\
  NOTE to [AFLOW_QSUB_MODE_EXPLICIT] \n\
   With [AFLOW_QSUB_MODE_EXPLICIT] activated, you can add: \n\
   [AFLOW_QSUB_MODE_EXPLICIT]START  and \n\
   [AFLOW_QSUB_MODE_EXPLICIT]STOP \n\
   This helps because instead of specifying QSUB with the \n\
   \"[AFLOW_QSUB_FILE]\" strings, everything between the ...]START \n\
   and ...]STOP keys are copied inside a QSUB. \n\
   This option is very useful trick to cut/paste long QSUBs \n\
   without adding the \"[AFLOW_QSUB_FILE]\" \n\
   strings ad the beginning of each line. \n\
 \n\
 [AFLOW_QSUB_MODE]COMMAND=\"string\"  OPTIONAL, default \"qsub\" \n\
  This is the command that is used to to submit a job \n\
  The default is qsub but you can change it for your needs. \n\
 \n\
 [AFLOW_QSUB_MODE]PARAMS=\"string\"  OPTIONAL, default nothing \n\
  These are the parameters that are used to submit a job \n\
  in the queue. \n\
 \n\
 NOTE: For MPI, the queue works in the same way, but the NCPUS=MAX \n\
  should be avoided because aflow can not predict in which \"note\" \n\
  the job will run (you might get as NCPUS the number of CPUS of the \n\
  master node !!). My best suggestion is that you put NCPUS as the \n\
  number you want. \n\
  The MPI keywords, START/STOP/COMMAND/BINARY are neglected. \n\
  You should prepare the \"aflow.qsub.run\" by yourself inside \n\
  aflow.in as the example below shows. \n\
  The MPI AUTOTUNE is performed, and this is very useful so \n\
  the INCAR is automatically adapted for MPI jobs. \n\
 \n\
 NOTE2: I wrote some shortcuts for common used batch systems. \n\
  With this parameters in aflow.in OR as command arguments, \n\
  you can avoid writing long and tedious batch scripts inside \n\
  the aflow.in \n\
  [AFLOW_QSUB_MODE]MODE1  equal to aflow --gsub1 \n\
  [AFLOW_QSUB_MODE]MODE2  equal to aflow --gsub2 \n\
  [AFLOW_QSUB_MODE]MODE3  equal to aflow --gsub3 \n\
  (Mode1 is for Gus-Stefano Mg project in Marylou4) \n\

******************************************************************************** \n\
[AFLOW_MODE=ALIEN] or [AFLOW_MODE_ALIEN] or [AFLOW_MODE]ALIEN \n\
 \n\
In MODE_ALIEN *************************************** \n\
You do not need to create ALIEN code files \n\
by hand. You can put everything inside aflow.in \n\
 \n\
[ALIEN_COMMAND]prog > output \n\
 Contains the command to run, it can contain the program and the output. \n\
 The input file can be contained in the EXPLICIT/IMPLICIT/EXTERNAL \n\
 For long commands you can make a script with \n\
  [ALIEN_COMMAND]START \n\
  prog1_do_something \n\
  prog2_do_something_else \n\
  [ALIEN_COMMAND]STOP \n\
 and all the output will be sent to \"output\". The START/STOP command \n\
 overrides the simple \"[ALIEN_COMMAND]prog > output\" specification. \n\
 \n\
[ALIEN_INPUT_FILE_**PLICIT] \n\
 Only the EXPLICIT mode of ALIEN is supported. Everything on \n\
 the left of \"[ALIEN_INPUT_FILE]\" strings is copied into an \"INPUT\" file \n\
 specified by the \"INPUT=\" keyword. \n\
 NOTE to [ALIEN_INPUT_FILE_EXPLICIT] \n\
  With [ALIEN_INPUT_FILE_EXPLICIT] activated, you can add: \n\
  [ALIEN_INPUT_FILE_EXPLICIT]START  and \n\
  [ALIEN_INPUT_FILE_EXPLICIT]STOP \n\
  This helps because instead of specifying INPUT file with the \n\
  \"[ALIEN_INPUT_FILE]\" strings, everything between the ...]START \n\
  and ...]STOP keys are copied inside the INPUT file. \n\
  This option is very useful trick to cut/paste long INPUT files \n\
  without adding the \"[ALIEN_FILE]\" \n\
  strings ad the beginning of each line. \n\
 \n\
[ALIEN_INPUT_FILE_EXTERNAL] \n\
 Searches a file or loads a file from stdout command: \n\
  [ALIEN_INPUT_FILE]FILE=../../somewhere/input \n\
  or \n\
  [ALIEN_INPUT_FILE]COMMAND=bzcat ../somewhere/input.bz2 \n\
 if FILE or COMMAND are not specified, aflow takes the standard \n\
 FILE=./input as default. \n\
 \n\
[ALIEN_INPUT_FILE_NAME]INPUT= \n\
 Specifies the name of the input file for the general ALIEN program. \n\
 If not specified, aflow takes \"./input\" as default \n\
 \n\
[ALIEN_OUTPUT_FILE_NAME]OUTPUT= \n\
 Specifies the name of the output file for the general ALIEN program. \n\
 If not specified, aflow takes \"./output\" as default \n\
 \n\
******************************************************************************** \n\
[AFLOW_MODE=MATLAB] or [AFLOW_MODE_MATLAB] or [AFLOW_MODE]MATLAB \n\
 \n\
In MODE_MATLAB *************************************** \n\
You do not need to create MATLAB code files \n\
by hand. You can put everything inside aflow.in \n\
 \n\
[AFLOW_MATLAB_MODE_**PLICIT]     MANDATORY, no default \n\
 Only the EXPLICIT mode of MATLAB is supported. Everything on \n\
 the left of \"[AFLOW_MATLAB_FILE]\" strings is copied into an \"aflow.m\" file. \n\
 This file is executed as \"matlab -r aflow > aflow.out\" \n\
 (check the binary location in the aflow_aflowrc.cpp file) and \n\
 the output is put in an \"aflow.out\" file. \n\
 This is usefull to create structures with matlab. \n\
 NOTE to [AFLOW_MATLAB_MODE_EXPLICIT] \n\
  With [AFLOW_MATLAB_MODE_EXPLICIT] activated, you can add: \n\
  [AFLOW_MATLAB_MODE_EXPLICIT]START  and \n\
  [AFLOW_MATLAB_MODE_EXPLICIT]STOP \n\
  This helps because instead of specifying MATLAB code with the \n\
  \"[AFLOW_MATLAB_FILE]\" strings, everything between the ...]START \n\
  and ...]STOP keys are copied inside a MATLAB code. \n\
  This option is very useful trick to cut/paste long MATLAB \n\
  codes without adding the \"[AFLOW_MATLAB_FILE]\" \n\
  strings ad the beginning of each line. \n\
 \n\
[AFLOW_MATLAB_MODE_EXTERNAL] \n\
 Searches a file or loads a file from stdout command: \n\
  [AFLOW_MATLAB_FILE]FILE=../../somewhere/prog.m \n\
  or \n\
  [AFLOW_MATLAB_FILE]COMMAND=bzcat ../somewhere/prog.m.bz2 \n\
 if FILE or COMMAND are not specified, aflow takes the standard \n\
 FILE=./prog.m as default. \n\
 \n\
****************************************************** \n\
[AFLOW_SYMMETRY] or [VASP_SYMMETRY]KEYWORD    OPTIONAL \n\
 Keyword to specify parameters. After [AFLOW_SYMMETRY] \n\
 you can put \n\
 CALCULATION         OPTIONAL \n\
  With this keyword aflow calculates: \n\
  * aflow.pgroup.out *: Point group of the lattice {R} \n\
  * aflow.fgroup.out *: Factor group of the cell {R|t}, \n\
  note that this might not be a \"true\" group. \n\
  * aflow.agroup.out *: Site point group for every atomic \n\
  position (the maximum symmorphic subgrop of the lattice \n\
  point group applied to each atomic point). \n\
  * aflow.sgroup.out *: Space group {R|t+T} with T \n\
  up to a radius from the origin. \n\
  Files: the poing and factor groups are saved in \n\
  aflow.pgroup.outand aflow.fgroup.out files. The site \n\
  point group is saved in aflow.agroup.out. \n\
  The aflow.sgroup.out file is not saves unless the \n\
  following keyword is specified \n\
 SGROUP_WRITE        OPTIONAL \n\
  Flag, if present, the space group is saved in a file \n\
  aflow.out.sgrop (use this with caution, the file might \n\
  get huge) \n\
 SGROUP_RADIUS=XXX   OPTIONAL, default XXX=5.0 \n\
  specifies the radius of a sphere around the origin \n\
  where the translations of the space group is calculated. \n\
  Be careful because the size of the space group increases \n\
  as the radius^3 times the size of the factor roup. \n\
 NO_SCAN             OPTIONAL \n\
  The symmetry routine involves consistency checks. When \n\
  a symmetry rule is broken, the tolerance is changed and  \n\
  recalculated. This keyword will not perform the scan if \n\
  symmetry rules are broken. \n\
 SYM_EPS             OPTIONAL, default minimum_interatomic_distance/100.0 \n\
  Specifies the tolerance for all symmetry routines.  \n\
  (In Angstroms). \n\

In MODE_VASP ************************************** \n\
You do not need to create INCAR/POSCAR/POTCAR/KPOINTS files \n\
by hand. You can put everything inside aflow.in \n\
 \n\
[VASP_RUN]KEYWORDs .. where keywords can be \n\
 \n\
 GENERATE            OPTIONAL \n\
  Generate all the files, and no vasp is generated. All the XCARs are generated and tuned accordingly \n\
  (the original versions are backup in the XCARs.origs). \n\
 \n\
 STATIC		OPTIONAL \n\
  Performs a STATIC run (different than RELAX=0). \n\
  The keys IBRION,NSW,ISIF are commented in the INCAR file. \n\
 \n\
 KPOINTS              OPTIONAL \n\
  Runs a swap of kpoints from the small to the prescribed ones so that the calculations \n\
  relax faster (but run more relaxations). This option can be used for kpoints convergence. \n\
 \n\
 RELAX=N		OPTIONAL, Default N=2 \n\
  Selects the number of relaxations RELAX=N with N=0 to 99999 (many relaxations!). \n\
  If N=0 then NO RUN is performed (XCARS are generated and twisted). \n\
 \n\
 RELAX_STATIC=N   	OPTIONAL, Default N=2 \n\
  Selects the number of relaxations RELAX_STATIC=N with N=0 to 99999 (many relaxations!). \n\
  If N=0 then NO RUN is performed (XCARS are generated and twisted). \n\
  After the N relaxations, a static run is performed with ad hoc INCARS. \n\
  Look for RELAX_STATIC options for tuning the calculations. \n\
 \n\
 RELAX_STATIC_BANDS=N	OPTIONAL, Default N=2 \n\
  Selects the number of relaxations RELAX_STATIC_BANDS=N with N=0 to 99999 (many relaxations!). \n\
  if N=0 then NO RUN is performed (XCARS are generated and twisted). \n\
  After the N relaxations, a static run is performed with ad hoc \n\
  INCARS.  After the STATIC run an BANDS canculation is performed. \n\
  Look for RELAX_STATIC_BANDS options for tuning the calculations. \n\
  You shall have a KPOINTS IMPLICIT and you must specify: \n\
  [VASP_KPOINTS_FILE]BANDS_LATTICE=fcc (cub,bcc,tet,bct,hex,orc,orci,orcc,orcf,rhl,tri,auto) \n\
  [VASP_KPOINTS_FILE]BANDS_GRID=16  (grid, thickness of vasp kpoints calcualations). \n\
  with BANDS_LATTICE=AUTO aflows determines the lattice just before the static run \n\
 \n\
 STATIC_BANDS	              OPTIONAL \n\
  A static run is performed with ad hoc  INCARS.  After the STATIC run \n\
  an BANDS canculation is performed. \n\
  Look for STATIC_BANDS options for tuning the calculations. \n\
  You shall have a KPOINTS IMPLICIT and you must specify: \n\
  [VASP_KPOINTS_FILE]BANDS_LATTICE=fcc (cub,bcc,tet,bct,hex,orc,orci,orcc,orcf,rhl,tri) \n\
  [VASP_KPOINTS_FILE]BANDS_GRID=16  (grid, thickness of vasp kpoints calcualations). \n\
 \n\
 DIELECTRIC_STATIC (or DS) \n\
  If a static calculation is present (RELAX_STATIC=N,RELAX_STATIC_BANDS=N,STATIC_BANDS) then \n\
  the keyword preceed by a comma will switch to DIELECTRIC_STATIC calculations operating \n\
  on the INCAR, through LRPA, LEPSILON, etc... The delta_K of the grid is choesen to be \n\
  It works only with vasp version > 5.2. \n\
  Note that this drops the NPAR switch to allow k-points resampling so you must have a LOT of RAM, \n\
  and set a large amount of stack (\"ulimit -s unlimited\"). If the code gets a MPICH error, it tries \n\
  to circumvent it increasing the stack and decreasing the KPOINTS. \n\
  Example: \n\
  will relax twice, perform the static calculations, get the bands, and run the static \n\
  dielectric run. \n\
 \n\
 DIELECTRIC_DYNAMIC (or DD) \n\
  If a static calculation is present (RELAX_STATIC=N,RELAX_STATIC_BANDS=N,STATIC_BANDS) then \n\
  the keyword preceed by a comma will switch to DIELECTRIC_DYNAMIC calculations operating \n\
  on the INCAR, through LRPA, LOPTICS, etc... \n\
  If not selected, it forces the DIELECTRIC_STATIC to be done before, as it requires the \n\
  dielectric_static wavefunction \n\
  Example \n\
  will relax twice, perform the static calculations, get the bands, and run the static \n\
  dielectric and then the final dynamic dielectric calculation. \n\
  It works only with vasp version > 5.2. \n\
 \n\
 REPEAT_BANDS	              OPTIONAL \n\
  This option is useful to repeat the band calculation after a previous \n\
  relax*, static and band performance. All the relax and static is preserved. \n\
  The INCAR.bands POTCAR.bands, and POSCAR.bands are preserved while the KPOINTS \n\
  is re-generated to allow different path. You can force this option by copying \n\
  LOCK into a file REPEAT_BANDS so aflow finds a new directory to run \n\
  (otherwise you shall delete LOCK and add the option to aflow.in). \n\
 \n\
REPEAT_STATIC_BANDS	              OPTIONAL \n\
  This option is useful to repeat the band calculation after a previous \n\
  relax*, static and band performance. All the relax and static is preserved. \n\
  The INCAR.static POTCAR.static, and POSCAR.static are preserved while the KPOINTS \n\
  is re-generated to allow different path. You can force this option by copying \n\
  LOCK into a file REPEAT_STATIC_BANDS so aflow finds a new directory to run \n\
  (otherwise you shall delete LOCK and add the option to aflow.in). \n\
 \n\
REPEAT_DELSOL	              OPTIONAL \n\
  This option is useful to repeat the delta-sol calculation after a previous \n\
  static run. All *.static or *.static.bz2 files are preserved. \n\
  The POSCAR.static, KPOINTS.static, POTCAR.static are copied to POSCAR, KPOINTS, POTCAR \n\
  for the delta-sol run. The INCAR.static is reread and modified to include NELECT tag. \n\
  N_0 = grep NELECT OUTCAR.static \n\
  Then delta_N is calculated using scheme from ref PRL 105,196403 (2010), two delta-sol runs are performed \n\
  (i) delta-sol plus (*.dsolp) with NELECT = N_0 + delta_N \n\
  (ii) delta-sol minus (*.dsolm) with NELECT = N_0 - delta_N \n\
  You can force this option by moving the LOCK file into a file named REPEAT_DELSOL \n\
  so aflow finds a new directory to run \n\
  (otherwise you shall delete LOCK and add the option to aflow.in). \n\
 \n\
NOTE: If you specify more than one GENERATE/STATIC/KPOINTS/RELAX/RELAX_STATIC \n\
 runs, the priority is GENERATE (1), STATIC (2), BANDS (3), KPOINTS (4), RELAX (5). \n\
 \n\
--- INPUT FILES --------------------------------------- \n\
 \n\
For INCAR,KPOINTS,POSCAR,POTCAR you must choose one of the \n\
available modes: EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, EXTERNAL \n\
 \n\
*** INCAR *** *** INCAR *** *** INCAR *** *** INCAR *** \n\
[VASP_INCAR_MODE_**PLICIT] \n\
 EXPLICIT and IMPLICIT mode of INCAR are supported. \n\
 In EXPLICIT mode everything on the left of \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" \n\
 strings is copied into INCAR files. \n\
 NOTE to [VASP_INCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT] \n\
  With [VASP_INCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT] activated, you can add: \n\
  [VASP_INCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT]START  and \n\
  [VASP_INCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT]STOP \n\
  This helps because instead of specifying INCAR with the \n\
  \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, everything between the ...]START \n\
  and ...]STOP keys are copied inside a INCAR. \n\
  This option is very useful trick to cut/paste long INCARs \n\
  without adding the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" \n\
  strings ad the beginning of each line. \n\
 In IMPLICIT mode the keyword \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]SYSTEM_AUTO\" \n\
 indicates aflow to take system, prototype and info names from \n\
 the POSCAR (available if taken from the databases). \n\
 NOTE after the EXPLICIT and IMPLICIT constructions, aflow fixes \n\
 the INCAR following the FORCE_OPTIONS keyword specified below. \n\
 \n\
 \n\
[VASP_INCAR_MODE_EXTERNAL] \n\
 Searches a file or loads a file from stdout command: \n\
  [VASP_INCAR_FILE]FILE=../../somewhere/INCAR \n\
  or \n\
  [VASP_INCAR_FILE]COMMAND=bzcat ../somewhere/INCAR.relax2.bz2 \n\
 if FILE or COMMAND are not specified, aflow takes the standard \n\
 FILE=./INCAR as default. \n\
 \n\
*** KPOINTS *** *** KPOINTS *** *** KPOINTS *** *** KPOINTS *** \n\
[VASP_KPOINTS_MODE_**PLICIT] \n\
  Both EXPLICIT and IMPLICIT are supported. \n\
  IMPLICIT:  Everything after the line containing \n\
  [VASP_KPOINTS_FILE] will be used to create the KPOINTS file. \n\
  Options are \n\
  KMODE=X      # MODE OF THE KPOINTS (same as second line of KPOINTS) \n\
  KPPRA=XXXX   # number of kpoints times the size of unit cell \n\
                 the grid is calculated with the function KPPRA \n\
  KSCHEME=Monkhorst-Pack  (or Gamma)# Kpoints scheme. The ones of VASP are \n\
               supported and you can use only 1 letter. \n\
          You can specify KSCHEME=AUTO (actually you need only =A) \n\
          and aflow takes 'G' for FCC/HEX lattices and 'M' otherwise \n\
  KSHIFT=X X X # the three shift to bring in/out the Gamma point \n\
               see manual \n\
  You can override the KPOINT generation only for the STATIC phase by enforcing: \n\
  STATIC_KMODE=X               # see KPOINTS for explanation \n\
  STATIC_KPPRA=XXXX            # see KPOINTS for explanation \n\
  STATIC_KSCHEME=Monkhorst-Pack# see KPOINTS for explanation \n\
  STATIC_KSHIFT=X X X          # see KPOINTS for explanation \n\
 \n\
 EXPLICIT: Everything after the line containing \n\
 [VASP_KPOINTS_MODE_EXPLICIT] will be used to generate the KPOINTS \n\
 file. Hence this string should be used once and just before the \n\
 KPOINTS information. \n\
 NOTE to [VASP_KPOINTS_MODE_EXPLICIT] \n\
  With [VASP_KPOINTS_MODE_EXPLICIT] activated, you can add: \n\
  [VASP_KPOINTS_MODE_EXPLICIT]START  and \n\
  [VASP_KPOINTS_MODE_EXPLICIT]STOP \n\
  This helps because instead of specifying KPOINTS with the \n\
  \"[VASP_KPOINTS_FILE]\" strings, everything between the ...]START \n\
  and ...]STOP keys are copied inside a KPOINTS. \n\
  This option is very useful trick to cut/paste long KPOINTSs \n\
  without adding the \"[VASP_KPOINTS_FILE]\" \n\
  strings ad the beginning of each line. \n\
 \n\
[VASP_KPOINTS_MODE_EXTERNAL] \n\
 Searches a file or loads a file from stdout command: \n\
  [VASP_KPOINTS_FILE]FILE=../../somewhere/KPOINTS \n\
  or \n\
  [VASP_KPOINTS_FILE]COMMAND=bzcat ../somewhere/KPOINTS.relax2.bz2 \n\
 if FILE or COMMAND are not specified, aflow takes the standard \n\
 FILE=./KPOINTS as default. \n\
 \n\
*** POSCAR *** *** POSCAR *** *** POSCAR *** *** POSCAR *** \n\
[VASP_POSCAR_MODE_**PLICIT] \n\
 EXPLICIT and IMPLICIT modes of POSCAR are supported. \n\
 In EXPLICIT mode everything on the left of \"[VASP_POSCAR_FILE]\" \n\
 strings is copied into POSCAR files. \n\
 NOTE to [VASP_POSCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT] \n\
  With [VASP_POSCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT] activated, you can add: \n\
  [VASP_POSCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT]START  and \n\
  [VASP_POSCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT]STOP \n\
  This helps because instead of specifying POSCAR with the \n\
  \"[VASP_POSCAR_FILE]\" strings, everything between the ...]START \n\
  and ...]STOP keys are copied inside a POSCAR. \n\
  This option is very useful trick to cut/paste long POSCARs \n\
  without adding the \"[VASP_POSCAR_FILE]\" \n\
  strings ad the beginning of each line. \n\
  [VASP_POSCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT]START.AAA \n\
   ... \n\
  [VASP_POSCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT]STOP.AAA \n\
  [VASP_POSCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT]START.BBB \n\
   ... \n\
  [VASP_POSCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT]STOP.BBB \n\
  aflow generates directories ARUN.AAA ARUN.BBB ... and runs them all \n\
  with the same parameters but dirrerent POSCARS \n\
 \n\
 In IMPLICIT mode, commands are given to generate structures. \n\
 The first must be the keywork \"PROTOTYPE=\", then we can have \n\
 \"SPECIES=\" and \"VOLUMES=\". Keywords are separated by \";\", while \n\
  values are separated by \",\". \n\
 PROTOTYPE=label identifies the label on the DMQC-HTQC or GUS \n\
  database of prototypes. \n\
 SPECIES=specieA,specieB,... identifies the atomic species. \n\
  You can add the \"_pv\", \"_sv\".. etc which is used for the POTCAR \n\
  atomatic generation. \n\
 VOLUMES=volumeA,volumeB,... identifies the volume per atom \n\
  of each specie and the overall volume of the cell is the sum \n\
  of each individual volumes (Vegard`s law). \n\
  If you specify only one volume, as \n\
  \"VOLUME=volume\", then the cell will be forced to have that \n\
  volume per atom (aflow takes \"volume\" and multiply times the \n\
  number of atoms in the cell). \n\
  If you do not specify any volume, then the CELL volume will \n\
  be taken from the closed packed atomic volume (fcc through \n\
  VASP) and averaged with the Vegard`s law. \n\
 Example \n\
  [VASP_POSCAR_FILE]PROTOTYPE=5;VOLUMES=20,10;SPECIES=Ag,Zr_sv; \n\
 You can change/force the volume created by PROTOTYPE with \n\
  [VASP_POSCAR_FILE]VOLUME=xxx \n\
  [VASP_POSCAR_FILE]VOLUME+=xxx \n\
  [VASP_POSCAR_FILE]VOLUME*=xxx \n\
 \n\
[VASP_POSCAR_MODE_EXTERNAL] \n\
 Searches a file or loads a file from stdout command: \n\
  [VASP_POSCAR_FILE]FILE=../../somewhere/POSCAR \n\
  or \n\
  [VASP_POSCAR_FILE]COMMAND=bzcat ../somewhere/CONTCAR.relax2.bz2 \n\
 if FILE or COMMAND are not specified, aflow takes the standard \n\
 FILE=./POSCAR as default. \n\
 \n\
*** POTCAR *** *** POTCAR *** *** POTCAR *** *** POTCAR *** \n\
[VASP_POTCAR_MODE_**PLICIT]     MANDATORY, no default \n\
 IMPLICIT: The \"POTCAR\" potential files specified after the \n\
 \"[VASP_POTCAR_FILE]\" strings are copied into POSCAR files. \n\
 If you specify the keyword \"[VASP_POTCAR_FILE]SYSTEM_AUTO\" \n\
 then aflow will extract the species names from the POSCAR \n\
 (stored inside the structure generation) adding before and after \n\
 the PREFIX and SUFFIX as: \n\
 [VASP_POTCAR_FILE]PREFIX=$POTCARDIR/pot_LDA/current/ \n\
 [VASP_POTCAR_FILE]SUFFIX=/POTCAR \n\
 This option is very powerful for atomatic generation of \n\
 calculations. \n\
 \n\
 EXPLICIT: Everything after the line containing \n\
 [VASP_POTCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT] will be used to generate the POTCAR \n\
 file. Hence this string should be used once and just before the \n\
 POTCAR information. \n\
 \n\
[VASP_POTCAR_MODE_EXTERNAL] \n\
 Searches a file or loads a file from stdout command: \n\
  [VASP_POTCAR_FILE]FILE=../../somewhere/POTCAR \n\
  or \n\
  [VASP_POTCAR_FILE]COMMAND=bzcat ../somewhere/CONTCAR.relax2.bz2 \n\
 if FILE or COMMAND are not specified, aflow takes the standard \n\
 FILE=./POTCAR as default. \n\
 \n\
--- FORCE OPTIONS --------------------------------------- \n\
 \n\
[VASP_FORCE_OPTION]KEYWORD \n\
 Force some parameters for VASP calculation, changing the input files \n\
 approptiately. They are all OPTIONALS. Possible keywords are: \n\
 \n\
 NOTUNE \n\
  Aflow/aflowd does not perform any modification of the input files so it \n\
  neglect all the FORCE_OPTIONs parameters. \n\
 \n\
 SYSTEM_AUTO \n\
  Adapt INCAR adding the system, prototype and info names from \n\
  the POSCAR (available if taken from the databases). \n\
 \n\
 STATIC \n\
  Adapt INCAR to perform a static run (IBRION,NSW,ISIF are commented). \n\
  You can mix RUN_RELAX and STATIC options to get particular behaviors. \n\
 \n\
 RELAX || RELAX_ALL \n\
  Adapt INCAR to perform a relaxed run adapting (default MODE_ENERGY) \n\
  IBRION=2      # relax with Conjugate Gradient \n\
  NSW=51        # relax for long \n\
  ISIF=3        # relax everything \n\
  but without specifying the way to add. \n\
 \n\
 RELAX_IONS \n\
  Adapt INCAR to perform a run in which only IONS are relaxed. \n\
 \n\
 RELAX_CELL_SHAPE \n\
  Adapt INCAR to perform a run in which only CELL_SHAPE is relaxed. \n\
 \n\
 RELAX_CELL_VOLUME \n\
  Adapt INCAR to perform a run in which only CELL_VOLUME is relaxed. \n\
 \n\
 RELAX_IONS_CELL_VOLUME \n\
  Adapt INCAR to perform a run in which only IONS_CELL_VOLUME is relaxed. \n\
  Vasp does not support relaxation of IONS and VOLUME at the same time so \n\
  aflow runs alternate relaxations volume/ions (relaxODD/relaxEVEN). I suggest \n\
  to bump up N in [RELAX=N] so you achieve better convergence. \n\
 \n\
 RELAX_MODE=ENERGY   (DEFAULT) \n\
  Adapt INCAR to perform a relaxed run minimizing the total energy \n\
  IBRION=2       # relax with Conjugate Gradient \n\
  NSW=51         # relax for long \n\
  ISIF=3         # relax everything \n\
 \n\
 RELAX_MODE=FORCES \n\
  Adapt INCAR to perform a relaxed run minimizing all the forces \n\
  NELMIN=4       # The forces have to be well converged \n\
  ADDGRID=.TRUE. # To support finer forces calculation \n\
  EDIFFG=-1E-5   # The final structure has to have zero forces! \n\
  IBRION=1       # More stable algorithm \n\
  NSW=100        # relax for very long \n\
  ISIF=3         # relax everything \n\
  If RELAX_MODE_FORCES and RELAX_MODE_ENERGY are both (or none) specified, \n\
  the derault is to take RELAX_MODE_ENERGY. \n\
 \n\
 PREC= LOW | MEDIUM | NORMAL | HIGH | ACCURATE), PRESERVED \n\
 PREC=LOW  (PREC=LOW) \n\
  After INCAR is generated by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to enhance precision by tuning the parameters: \n\
  ENMAX = XXXX         # 1.0 ENMAX of pseudopotentials \n\
  PREC  = low          # reduce wrap around errors \n\
  Note: the 1.0 can be changed in .aflow.rc (DEFAULT_VASP_PREC_ENMAX_MEDIUM). \n\
 \n\
 PREC=MEDIUM  (PREC=MEDIUM)  \n\
  After INCAR is generated by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to enhance precision by tuning the parameters: \n\
  ENMAX = XXXX         # 1.3 ENMAX of pseudopotentials \n\
  PREC  = med          # reduce wrap around errors \n\
  Note: the 1.3 can be changed in .aflow.rc (DEFAULT_VASP_PREC_ENMAX_MEDIUM). \n\
 \n\
 PREC=NORMAL  (PREC=NORMAL) \n\
  After INCAR is generated by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to enhance precision by tuning the parameters: \n\
  ENMAX = XXXX         # 1.3 ENMAX of pseudopotentials \n\
  PREC  = normal       # reduce wrap around errors \n\
  Note: the 1.3 can be changed in .aflow.rc (DEFAULT_VASP_PREC_ENMAX_NORMAL). \n\
 \n\
 PREC=ACCURATE  (or PREC=HIGH or PREC=ACCURATE) (default=ACCURATE if not specified) \n\
  After INCAR is generated by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to enhance precision by uning the parameters: \n\
  ENMAX = XXXX         # 1.4 ENMAX of pseudopotentials \n\
  PREC  = Accurate     # avoid wrap around errors \n\
  LREAL = .FALSE.      # reciprocal space projection technique \n\
  EDIFF = 1E-6         # high accuracy required \n\
  ALGO  = Fast         # fast determination of ground state \n\
  Note: the 1.4 can be changed in .aflow.rc (DEFAULT_VASP_PREC_ENMAX_HIGH). \n\
 PREC=PRESERVED \n\
  When AFLOW switches from relax to static and to bands, the PREC is preserved and not changed accordingly. Good for calculations with \n\
  PREC conserved through the task. \n\
 \n\
 AUTO_PSEUDOPOTENTIALS=pot_LDA | pot_GGA | potpaw_LDA | potpaw_GGA | potpaw_PBE | potpaw_LDA_KIN | potpaw_PBE_KIN  \n\
  Aflow will take the standardized pseudopotential of the specified type associated to the species described in the POTENTIAL part of the aflow.in. \n\
  The default is the value specified in .aflow.rc DEFAULT_VASP_PSEUDOPOTENTIAL_TYPE=potpaw_PBE \n\
 \n\
 ENMAX_MULTIPLY=NUMBER (default is DEFAULT_VASP_PREC_ENMAX_LOW, _MEDIUM, _NORMAL, _HIGH, _ACCURATE see .aflow.rc \n\
  Force the user choice of MULTIPLIER of the max_cutoff of pseudopotentials. Usually 1.2-1.4.  \n\
  Increase to 1.5 or higher for high-pressure calculations. \n\
 \n\
 ALGO=(NORMAL | VERYFAST | FAST | ALL | DAMPED), PRESERVED \n\
 ALGO=XXXXXX \n\
  After INCAR is generated by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, aflow re-adapts INCAR to enforce ALGO=XXXXXX tuning the parameter \n\
  ALGO and removing IALGO. \n\
  ALGO = XXXXXX        # ALGO - XXXXXX \n\
   XXXXX can be NORMAL | VERYFAST | FAST | ALL | DAMPED \n\
 ALGO_PRESERVED \n\
  When AFLOW switches from relax to static and to bands, the ALGO is preserved and not changed to \"normal\". Good for calculations which \n\
  relax correctly but crash on the static part. \n\
 \n\
METAGGA=TPSS | RTPSS | M06L | MBJL | SCAN | MS0 | MS1 | MS2 | NONE \n\
 METAGGA=XXXXXX \n\
  After INCAR is generated by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to enforce METAGGA=XXXXXX tuning the parameter \n\
  METAGGA = XXXXXX        # METAGGA = XXXXXX \n\
   XXXXX can be TPSS | RTPSS | M06L | MBJL | SCAN | MS0 | MS1 | MS2 | NONE \n\
   If NONE or nothing is specified, the METAGGA keyword is not  included in the INCAR. \n\
 \n\
IVDW=number_for_VASP_see_manual_for_IVDW \n\
 IVDW=XXXXXX \n\
  After INCAR is generated by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to enforce IVDW=XXXXXX tuning the parameter \n\
  IVDW = XXXXXX        # IVDW = XXXXXX \n\
   If 0 or nothing is specified, the VDW keyword is not  included in the INCAR. \n\
   Note that other parameters might have to be specified in the INCAR part of aflow.in by the user \n\
 \n\
 NBANDS \n\
  After INCAR is generaged by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, aflow/aflowd extimates the number of NBANDS and add the informaiton \n\
  to the proper input files. \n\
 NBANDS=XXXX \n\
  After INCAR is generaged by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, aflow/aflowd used XXXX as number of bands. This is useful for automatic correction and restart. \n\
  If the entry exists, it will override the original INCAR specification of the user. \n\
 \n\
 PSTRESS=XXXX  (in kB) (PRESSURE) \n\
  After INCAR is generaged by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, aflow/aflowd adapts it for pressure calculations with PSTRESS=XXX. \n\
  If the entry exists, it will override the original INCAR specification of the user. \n\
 \n\
 EDIFFG=XXXX  (convergence for forces) \n\
  After INCAR is generaged by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, aflow/aflowd adapts it for relaxed forces calculations with EDIFFG=XXX. \n\
  If the entry exists, it will override the original INCAR specification of the user. \n\
 \n\
 NEGLECT_NOMIX \n\
  The run is not performed if the system is known to be immiscible. \n\
  The list of immiscibles are in aflow_nomix.cpp. \n\
 \n\
 SPIN=ON \n\
  After INCAR is generated by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, \n\
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to include SPIN. \n\
  If no SPIN is mentioned the INCAR spin part remains untouched. \n\
 SPIN=OFF \n\
  After INCAR is generated by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, \n\
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to exclude SPIN. \n\
  If no SPIN is mentioned the INCAR spin part remains untouched. \n\
 SPIN=REMOVE_RELAX_1 \n\
  After 1 RELAXATION is performed, if there is no spin in the calculation, \n\
  the spin is turned off automatically to save computer time and \n\
  make relaxations easier. Default cutoff is 0.025 specified in aflow_aflowrc.cpp \n\
  (DEFAULT_VASP_SPIN_REMOVE_CUTOFF) \n\
 SPIN=REMOVE_RELAX_2 \n\
  After 2 RELAXATIONS are performed, if there is no spin in the calculation, \n\
  the spin is turned off automatically to save computer time and \n\
  make relaxations easier. Default cutoff is 0.025 specified in aflow_aflowrc.cpp \n\
  (DEFAULT_VASP_SPIN_REMOVE_CUTOFF) \n\
 \n\
 BADER=ON | OFF (default OFF) \n\
  After INCAR is generated by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, \n\
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to include BADER analysis (LAECHG).  \n\
  It works only on the STATIC part of a run. RELAX_STATIC and RELAX_STATIC_BANDS  \n\
  have this option automatic. \n\
  By specifying OFF, aflow will strip the INCAR of any BADER related instruction. \n\
 \n\
 ELF=ON | OFF (default OFF) \n\
  After INCAR is generated by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, \n\
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to include the Electron Localization Function (ELF) analysis (LELF).  \n\
  It works only on the STATIC part of a run. \n\
  By specifying OFF, aflow will strip the INCAR of any ELF related instruction. \n\
 \n\
 LSCOUPLING=ON \n\
  After INCAR is generated by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, \n\
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to include LSCOUPLING. \n\
  If you have good INCARs, you do not need to play with these options. \n\
  LSORBIT=.TRUE. \n\
  LNONCOLLINEAR=.TRUE. \n\
  It does not touch SAXIS = s_x s_y s_z so the default (0+,0,1) is kept, \n\
  unless you specify something dufferent in the INCAR part of aflow.in \n\
  (\"0+\" implies an infinitesimal small positive number in x direction). \n\
  With LSCOUPLING=ON MAGMOM is adapted as a vector for each atom. \n\
  When you're doing non-collinear calculations you have to specify a \n\
  vector for each atom, i.e. three entries per atom. So if you have N \n\
  ions you therefore will have to have 3N elements on the MAGMOM-line \n\
  which are the projections onto the chosen SAXIS. \n\
  NOTE: with LSORBIG and LNONCOLLINEAR calculations VASP must be compiled \n\
  without the option -DNGZhalf and -DNGXhalf. \n\
  AFLOW expects the executable to be called as \"BIN\"+\"LS\", therefore \n\
  if you specify \"mpivasp46s\", the LS run will be performed calling \"mpivasp46sLS\". \n\
 LSCOUPLING=OFF \n\
  After INCAR is generated by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, \n\
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to exclude LSCOUPLING. \n\
  LSORBIT=.FALSE. \n\
  LNONCOLLINEAR=.FALSE. \n\
  MAGMOM is not touched and is left to be specified by AUTO_MAGMOM \n\
  or by the INCAR part of aflow.in. \n\
 \n\
 AUTO_MAGMOM=ON \n\
  After INCAR is generated by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, \n\
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to include AUTO_MAGMOM. \n\
  If you have good INCARs, you do not need to play with these options. \n\
 AUTO_MAGMOM=OFF \n\
  After INCAR is generated by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, \n\
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to exclude AUTO_MAGMOM. \n\
  If you have good INCARs, you do not need to play with these options. \n\
 \n\
 SYM=ON \n\
  After INCAR is generated by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, \n\
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to include SYMMETRY (ISYM=2). \n\
  If you have good INCARs, you do not need to play with these options. \n\
 SYM=OFF \n\
  After INCAR is generated by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, \n\
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to exclude SYMMETRY (ISYM=0). \n\
  If you have good INCARs, you do not need to play with these options. \n\
 \n\
 KPOINTS=EVEN | ODD  \n\
  Aflow makes KPOINTS even/odd. \n\
 KPOINTS=KSHIFT_GAMMA_EVEN | _ODD \n\
  Aflow shift of 1/2 the K points that are even/odd. \n\
 KPOINTS=GAMMA \n\
  Aflow sets [1 1 1] K points. You should specify the correct BINARY for the \n\
  the gamma point calculation (faster) otherwise aflow will run the normal vasp. \n\
 KPOINTS=KSCHEME_MONKHORST_PACK \n\
  Aflow forces Monkhorst-Pack Kscheme \n\
 KPOINTS=KSCHEME_GAMMA \n\
  Aflow forces Gamma Kscheme \n\
 KPOINTS=KSCHEME_AUTO \n\
  Aflow forces Kscheme to be Gamma for FCC/HEX lattices and Monkhorst-Pack for everything else. \n\
 KPOINTS=IBZKPT \n\
  Aflow uses IBZKPT.relax1 to proceed for relaxations >=2. \n\
 \n\
 WAVECAR=ON \n\
  After INCAR is generated by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, \n\
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to include WAVECAR. (LWAVE = .TRUE.) \n\
  If you have good INCARs, you do not need to play with these options. \n\
 WAVECAR=OFF \n\
  After INCAR is generated by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, \n\
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to exclude WAVECAR. (LWAVE = .FALSE.) \n\
  If you have good INCARs, you do not need to play with these options. \n\
 \n\
 CHGCAR=ON \n\
  After INCAR is generated by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, \n\
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to include CHGCAR. (LCHARG = .TRUE.) \n\
  If you have good INCARs, you do not need to play with these options. \n\
 CHGCAR=OFF \n\
  After INCAR is generated by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, \n\
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to exclude CHGCAR. (LCHARG = .FALSE.) \n\
  If you have good INCARs, you do not need to play with these options. \n\
 \n\
 CHGCAR_FILE=XXXX (XXXX = path to file) \n\
   Uses the CHGCAR file this option is set to to start the VASP calculation. \n\
   ICHARG is set to 1 when this option is set. If the run type is a relaxation \n\
   calculation, the CHGCAR file will only be used for the first one. ICHARG \n\
   is then set to 2 for the subsequent relaxations. \n\
 \n\
 RWIGS_STATIC \n\
  When running a STATIC calculation (STATIC, RELAX_STATIC, RELAX_BAND_STATIC) \n\
  it extracts RWIGS from the POTCAR (and forces LORBIT=0) \n\
 \n\
 TYPE=METAL or TYPE=INSULATOR or TYPE=SEMICONDUCTOR or TYPE=DEFAULT \n\
  Aflow arranges the integration method of the Brillouin Zone for Metals or \n\
  Insulators/Semiconductors by tuning ISMEAR and SIGMA. Look at the manual. \n\
  This key is very important for forces calculations (not really for bulk energies) \n\
  since the tetrahedron method with Blochl corrections is NOT variational \n\
  in the forces, so the answers might be wrong in some cases. \n\
  ISMEAR = 2     # default (hope) \n\
  SIGMA = 0.2    # default (hope) \n\
  ISMEAR = 1     # for metals \n\
  SIGMA = 0.1    # for metals \n\
  ISMEAR = 0     # for insulators/semiconductors \n\
  SIGMA = 0.05   # for insulators/semiconductors \n\
  This keyword is MANDATORY if you are doing phonons calculations. \n\
 \n\
 ISMEAR=XXXX  (smearing) \n\
  After INCAR is generaged by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, aflow/aflowd adapts it for relaxed forces calculations with ISMEAR=XXX. \n\
  If the entry exists, it will override the original INCAR specification of the user. \n\
  This will override what is specified by TYPE. \n\
  \n\
 SIGMA=XXXX  (smearing) \n\
  After INCAR is generaged by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, aflow/aflowd adapts it for relaxed forces calculations with SIGMA=XXX. \n\
  If the entry exists, it will override the original INCAR specification of the user. \n\
  This will override what is specified by TYPE. \n\
 \n\
 LDAU1=ON   | OFF | ADIABATIC | CUTOFF \n\
  After INCAR is generated by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, \n\
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to include LDAU in the mode 1 of VASP. \n\
  You need to specify the species with the keyword. \n\
  With ADIABATIC it turns on LDAU adiabatically through the relaxN steps. \n\
  If n is the max number of relaxes and j is the step then the U and J parameters are \n\
  set as j/n*(U,J) per calcuation. The minimum step of ADIABATIC relaxations is set \n\
  up to be LDAU_ADIABATIC_RELAX_DEFAULT=6, and can  be modified in aflow_kvasp.cpp \n\
  With CUTOFF, aflow adds an extra relaxation step (RELAX++). The extra step is performed \n\
  with a recycled CHGCAR of the previous step, static, and turning off all LDAU calculations. \n\
  This is very useful to canculate non LDAU energies with LDAU charge distributions. \n\
 \n\
 LDAU2=ON   | OFF | ADIABATIC | CUTOFF \n\
  After INCAR is generated by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, \n\
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to include LDAU in the mode 2 of VASP. \n\
  You need to specify the species with the keyword. \n\
  With ADIABATIC it turns on LDAU adiabatically through the relaxN steps. \n\
  If n is the max number of relaxes and j is the step then the U and J parameters are \n\
  set as j/n*(U,J) per calcuation. The minimum step of ADIABATIC relaxations is set \n\
  up to be LDAU_ADIABATIC_RELAX_DEFAULT=6, and can  be modified in aflow_kvasp.cpp \n\
  With CUTOFF, aflow adds an extra relaxation step (RELAX++). The extra step is performed \n\
  with a recycled CHGCAR of the previous step, static, and turning off all LDAU calculations. \n\
  This is very useful to canculate non LDAU energies with LDAU charge distributions. \n\
 \n\
  To specify the parameters, you can have AFLOW to choose for you \n\
  with LDAU_SPECIES of do by hand through LDAY_PARAMETERS. \n\
 LDAU_SPECIES=Cu La O Ru    (separated by spaces, no commas) so that aflow \n\
  picks the right parameters from the AVASP_Get_LDAU1_Parameters() routine (aflow_avasp.cpp). \n\
  If no LDAU_SPECIES are present, you have to specify LDAUL, LDAUU, LDAUJ manually \n\
  in the INCAR. \n\
 LDAU_PARAMETERS=speciesA,speciesB..;L_A,L_B..;U_A,U_B..;J_A,J_B... \n\
  for example (groups separated by \";\" while entries separated by \",\") \n\
  Cu,La,O,Ru;0,2,1,-1;0.0,4.2,1.1,0.0;0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0 \n\
  where \n\
  Cu,La,O,Ru       LDAU set of species \n\
  0,2,1,-1         LDAU orbitals with -1,0,1,2,3 = none,s,p,d,f \n\
  0.0,4.2,1.1,0.0  LDAU Us for species \n\
  0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0  LDAU Js for species \n\
  Note: LDAU_PARAMETERS overrides LDAU_SPECIES. \n\
 \n\
 LDAU=OFF | LDAU1=OFF | LDAU2=OFF \n\
  After INCAR is generated by the \"[VASP_INCAR_FILE]\" strings, \n\
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to exclude all LDAU calculations. \n\
 \n\
 \n\
 CONVERT_UNIT_CELL=STRING1,STRING2,... etc where STRINGS can be \n\
 \n\
  STANDARD_PRIMITIVE | STD_PRIM | SPRIM \n\
   Converts the unit cell to the standard primitive form as described \n\
   by the rules in the aflow_kpoints.cpp file and in the README_LATTICE file \n\
   If specified, it turns off  NIGGLI, MINKOWSKI, INCELL, COMPACT, WIGNERSEITZ. \n\
   If both STANDARD_PRIMITIVE and STANDARD_CONVENTIONAL then PRIMITIVE has priority. \n\
   REF: Setyawan Curtarolo, DOI: 10.1016/j.commatsci.2010.05.010 \n\
  STANDARD_CONVENTIONAL | STD_CONV | SCONV \n\
   Converts the unit cell to the standard primitive form as described \n\
   by the rules in the aflow_kpoints.cpp file and in the README_LATTICE file \n\
   If specified, it turns off  NIGGLI, MINKOWSKI, INCELL, COMPACT, WIGNERSEITZ. \n\
   If both STANDARD_PRIMITIVE and STANDARD_CONVENTIONAL then PRIMITIVE has priority. \n\
   REF: Setyawan Curtarolo, DOI: 10.1016/j.commatsci.2010.05.010 \n\
  NIGGLI \n\
   Converts the unit cell to the standardized Niggli form.  The \n\
   form is unique (up to some signs, I think).  The transformation \n\
   makes use of only the lattice vectors and does not depend on the \n\
   basis atoms.  This will work on any cell, but it treats the given \n\
   cell as primitive, and it will not reduce the cell to primitive \n\
   if it is not primitive already.  At present the algorithm seems to \n\
   hang if I force more than about 6 digits of accuracy so be aware that \n\
   small errors might be introduced (these can break symmetry!). \n\
   (Written by Dane Morgan). \n\
  MINKOWSKI | MINK \n\
   Converts the unit cell with the Minkowski reduction \n\
   This routine takes a set of basis vectors (that form a lattice) \n\
   and reduces them so that they form the shortest possible basis. \n\
   The reduction is performed so that each vector \"a_i\" is a close \n\
   as possible to the origin while remaining in the affine plane which \n\
   is defined by \"a_j\", \"a_k\" but shifted by \"a_i\", for any choice \n\
   of even permutations of i,j,k in 1,2,3. \n\

   ISBN 3-540-22156-5 \n\
   Written by Gus Hart in F90, recoded by SC in C++ (Sep/08). \n\
  INCELL \n\
   Convert the basis with all atoms mapped to their images within \n\
   the unit cell. \n\
  COMPACT \n\
   Convert the basis with all atoms mapped through the unit and neighbours \n\
   cells to minimixe the shortest possible bond with an adjacent atom \n\
   This option is very useful if you run big and complicate \n\
   molecules where atoms exit of the unit cell and you have \n\
   problems understanding where they are because visualization \n\
   packages do not show bonds anymore ... \n\
  WIGNERSEITZ | WS \n\
   Convert the basis with all atoms mapped to their images within \n\
   the Wigner Seitz cell. \n\
  CARTESIAN | CART \n\
   Convert the basis set to Cartesian coordinates. \n\
  FRACTIONAL  | DIRECT | FRAC | DIR \n\
   Convert the basis set to fractional coordinates. \n\
  PRESERVE | PRES \n\
   Preserve the POSCAR from being Standardized (Primitive or Coventional). \n\
 \n\
 VOLUME=xxx \n\
 VOLUME+=xxx \n\
 VOLUME*=xxx \n\
  Change the volume of the POSCAR accordingly (fix, +=, *=) as in the c,c++ standard. \n\
 \n\

 \n\
  aflow --abccar < POSCAR | WYCCAR \n\
        Converts the POSCAR or WYCCAR in format. \n\
        POSCAR is the usual VASP file \n\
        WYCCAR is described as \n\
        TITLE \n\
         SCALE (positive (rescaling) negative (volume)) \n\
         A B C ALPHA BETA GAMMA SG# [OPTION#] \n\

         .. .. .. specie1 \n\
         .. .. .. specie1 \n\
         and so on. (Stefano Feb 2009) \n\
        The positions of the species will be used with the list of \n\
        symmetry operations (aflow_wyckoff.cpp) to generate all the atoms. \n\
 \n\
  aflow --abinit                                                                     \n\
        Transforms the POSCAR (or whicever is the input file format) to a               \n\
        ABINIT GEOM format.                                                   \n\
        The geometrical file follows the ABINIT convention.    \n\
 \n\
  aflow --aims                                                                     \n\
        Transforms the POSCAR (or whicever is the input file format) to a               \n\
        AIMS GEOM format.                                                   \n\
        The geometrical file follows the AIMS convention.    \n\
 \n\
  aflow --ace < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out a cell standard ASCII (ace) file \n\
        based on the POSCAR input file.  This can be used as input \n\
        for CaRIne. \n\
 \n\
  aflow --aflux=\"<summons>\" \n\
        Command line interface to use the AFLUX Search API. \n\
        <summons> has the same syntax as described in the article (doi: 10.1016/j.commatsci.2017.04.036). \n\
        Though not required, it is recommended to put the summons between double quotes, \n\
        so the user does not have to escape any parentheses. \n\
        e.g. command: \n\
          aflow --aflux=\"enthalpy_formation_atom,natoms,sg2(*',Fm-3m #225'),aurl,species((Cl:Br),(Na:K)),nspecies(2),format(aflow),paging(0)\" \n\
 \n\
  aflow --use_aflow.in=XXX \n\
        Uses XXX instead of \"aflow.in\" in searching/running/operating directories. \n\
        The option is very useful for compounded calculations. \n\
	 \n\
  aflow --aflowin  < POSCAR \n\
        Output the structure inside the strings: \n\
        [VASP_POSCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT]START \n\
        structure... \n\
        [VASP_POSCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT]STOP \n\
        which is useful if you want to recycle partially ran aflow.in ! \n\
 \n\
  aflow [options] --aflow_proto=label*:speciesA*[:speciesB*][:volumeA*[:volumeB*]|:volume] [--params=..... [--hex]] \n\

         --hex          { check aflow --readme=anrl } \n\
 \n\
        This command generates the directory: ./AFLOWDATA/speciesAspeciesB/label/ \n\
        and create an aflow.in inside with the \"label\" structure from \n\
        HTQC library project, with speciesAs, speciesBs,.. and the volumes per atoms, \n\
        volumeAs, volumeBs,.. (real in A^3). \n\
        Aflow generates a huge number, #speciesAs*#speciesBs...*#label[*#pressures], \n\
        of directories containing all the combinations of \n\
        ./AFLOWDATA/speciesAspeciesB../label:pressure \n\
        and so on. This is helpful for generating huge databases. \n\
 \n\
        Be careful to include the various \"_pv,_sv, etc\" in the species so that \n\
        the POTCAR makes sense. \n\
        HIGH-THROUGHPUT NOTE: label, speciesA, speciesB, volumeA, volumeB can be \n\
        multiple strings separated by commas without spaces in between such as \n\
        Note that that --aflow_proto label A B ... is not supported anymore and you now need to use \n\
        --aflow_proto=label:A:B... et cetera. \n\
 \n\
      LABEL \n\
	  label* = string of label1,label2,label3,... separated by commas \",\" \n\
         specify which labels/prototypes to generate \n\
 \n\
      SPECIES \n\
        speciesA* = string of speciesA1,speciesA2,speciesA3,... separated by commas \",\" \n\
         specify which species in position A to consider. \n\
        speciesB* = string of speciesB1,speciesB2,speciesB3,... separated by commas \",\" \n\
         specify which species in position B to consider. \n\
        similarily you can have speciesC*,speciesD*, and so on. \n\
 \n\
      VOLUMES \n\
        volumeA* = string of volumeA1,volumeA2,volumeA3,... separated by commas \",\" \n\
         specify the volumes of speciesAs, the number must be identical to the number \n\
         of speciesAs otherwise you get an error. \n\
        volumeB* = string of volumeB1,volumeB2,volumeB3,... separated by commas \",\" \n\
         specify the volumes of speciesBs, the number must be identical to the number \n\
         of speciesBs otherwise you get an error. \n\
        similarily you can have volumeC*,volumeD*, and so on. \n\
        If you want to set one volume per atom, identical to all the species, then \n\
        specify only one number as species...:volume . \n\
 \n\
      USAGE \n\
        With --usage a brief syntax help comes out. \n\
 \n\
      POTENTIALS \n\
        The user can specify the potential type. \n\
        --potential=pot_LDA | pot_GGA | potpaw_LDA | potpaw_GGA | potpaw_PBE | potpaw_LDA_KIN | potpaw_PBE_KIN  \n\
        If not specified it takes potpaw_PBE and the standard default for the species. \n\
        With --potential_complete it creates the subdirectory containing the type and \n\
        date of the potentials: i.e. Ti_sv => Ti_sv:PAW_GGA:07Sep2000 \n\
        With the option --noautopp, then you have to be careful to include the various \n\
        \"_pv,_sv, etc\" in the species so that the POTCAR makes sense. \n\
 \n\
      MISSING \n\
        With the option --missing  it creates automatic aflow.in only for the missing . \n\
        structures of the database. It checks on: \n\
        $(vAFLOW_PROJECTS_DIRS.at(XHOST_LIBRARY_LIB0))/LIB/        of AFLOW_MATERIALS_SERVER \n\
        $(vAFLOW_PROJECTS_DIRS.at(XHOST_LIBRARY_LIB1))/LIB/        of AFLOW_MATERIALS_SERVER \n\

     BADER CALCULATION \n\
        With --bader, the proper flags are set in the INCAR to write the AECCAR's for the bader calculation. \n\
 \n\
     SPIN_REMOVE_RELAX_1 _2 \n\
        With --spin_remove_relax_1 _2, the user can indicate when to avoid a spin-polarized calculation if \n\
        the system's magnetic moment is negligible. \n\
        \n\
     KPOINTS SPECIFICATION \n\
        With --kppra=NNN the user can specify a NNN number of kpoints per reciprocal atom. \n\
        Input KPPRA (6,000-10,000 recommended) is the lower bound of the product of the  \n\
        (total count of k-points in the 3-D grid) and  \n\
        (number of atoms in the cell).  \n\
        The smallest mesh to satisfy this requirement is calculated.  \n\
        Effectively, cells with more atoms will yield smaller grid meshes. \n\
        The user can also specify the scheme with --kscheme=[M | G]. \n\
        The static variants can also be set via command-line. \n\
  \n\
     PRESSURE CALCULATIONS \n\
        The user can run calculations under pressure by adding --pressure (kB). \n\
        --pressure=p0[,p1][,p1]... \n\
        Example \n\
        --pressure=10,20,30 \n\
        Then the data will be generated as directories containing all the combinations of \n\
        ./AFLOWDATA/specieAspecieB/label:P=p0/ \n\
        ./AFLOWDATA/specieAspecieB/label:P=p1/ \n\
        The input file aflow.in will contain the correct PSTRESS=** entry \n\
     \n\
      BANDS CALCULATIONS \n\
        The user can run bands by adding --bands \n\
 \n\
      MODULE PARAMETERS \n\
        The user can set up a module-specific run by adding --module=MODULE, where \n\
        current options include APL (harmonic phonon analysis), QHA (quasi-harmonic phonon analysis), \n\
        and AAPL (anharmonic phonon analysis). \n\
        This option will, e.g., uncomment [AFLOW_APL]CALC. \n\
        [APL | QHA | AAPL] \n\
         \n\
      APL MODULE PARAMETERS \n\
        Use --apl_supercell=NxNxN to override MINATOMS tag and set the supercell size \n\
 \n\

        --ediffg=XXX parameter overrides the default value (default: DEFAULT_VASP_PREC_EDIFFG_XXXX in .aflow.rc) for very precise relaxed forces calculations. \n\
	 \n\
      LDAU CALCULATIONS (FORCING IT ON AND OFF) \n\
        The user can run bands by adding --ldau2 and the code will take the default ldau \n\
        parameters that are specified inside aflow_avasp.cpp. \n\
        If you do not like them, you can modify the cpp code OR change the lines inside aflow.in \n\
        [VASP_FORCE_OPTION]LDAU2=ON \n\
        For some reference systems, LDAU is taken by default. Then the user can remove it \n\
        with --noldau. \n\
 \n\
      MIXING (TO MIX OR NOT TO MIX) \n\
        Some systems is known to be no-mix, and they will be skipped from the calculations. \n\
        To override this automatism, specify --neglect_nomix . \n\
 \n\
      STDOUT output \n\
        If you specify --stdout, aflow will not write the file but print on the screen. \n\
 \n\
      QUANTUM ESPRESSO output                                                                      \n\
        If you specify --qe, aflow will add QUANTUM ESPRESSO code to aflow.in (experimental).    \n\
 \n\
      ABINIT output                                                                      \n\
        If you specify --abinit, aflow will add ABINIT code to aflow.in (experimental).    \n\
 \n\
      AIMS output                                                                      \n\
        If you specify --aims, aflow will add AIMS code to aflow.in (experimental).    \n\
 \n\
      LIST output \n\
        If you specify --list, aflow will not generate the aflow.ins but only report the \n\
         ones to be created (useful for scripting). \n\
 \n\
      ANRL: AFLOW NAVAL RESEARCH LAB PROTOTYPE LIBRARY \n\
        With respect to the article: \n\
        the code gives the possibility to define the parameters of the cell --params=... \n\
        Some rhombohedral cells can be generated in hexagonal configurations (see the article). \n\
        The choice is performed with the flag --hex. \n\
        Check aflow --readme=anrl  \n\
 \n\
  aflow --aflow_proto=label[:]specieA[:]specieB[:]volume \n\
        Same as above but the volume per atoms are extracted from the \n\
        most dense paw_pbe values (usually the ground state) and with \n\
        the Vegard`s law  (Vegard's law is an approximate empirical rule \n\
        which holds that a linear relation exists, at constant temperature, \n\
        between the crystal lattice constant of an alloy and the \n\
        concentrations of the constituent elements). \n\
        HIGH-THROUGHPUT NOTE: label, specieA, specieB can be \n\
        multiple strings separated by commas without spaces in between such as \n\
        label1,label2,label3          generate all the labels \n\
        specieA1,specieA2,specieA3    goes through all specieAs times all Bs \n\
        specieB1,specieB2             goes through all specieBs times all As \n\
        In this case aflow generates a huge number, #labels*#specieAs*#specieB \n\
        of directories containing all the combinations of \n\
        ./AFLOWDATA/specieA?specieB?/label? \n\
        and so on. This is helpful for generating huge databases. \n\
        PRESSURE, POTENTIALS, BANDS calculations are allowed, see above. \n\
        STDOUT option available. \n\

	   \n\
  aflow --aflowSG[_label,_number][=tolerance | =tight | =loose] [--no_scan] [--mag|--magnetic|--magmom=[m1,m2,...|INCAR|OUTCAR]] < POSCAR \n\
        Calculates the space group of the crystal in the ITC convention. \n\
        No assumptions are made on the input POSCAR-- may be supercell, primitive, etc. \n\
        Gives the Bravais lattice, crystal system, point group, space group number and wyckoff set. \n\
        The origin choice is always the first choice in ITC 5th edition. This is the highest symmetry \n\
        choice. (However, for Monoclinic systems, different unique axes and cell choices are examined to \n\
        ensure a spacegroup is identified.) This routine consists of an adaptive tolerance; if any symmetry  \n\
        rules are broken, the tolerance is changed and everything is recalculated. \n\
        Tolerance: \n\
           The tolerance is given in Angstroms.  There are two preset tolerances: \n\
             tight: minimum_interatomic_distance/100.0 \n\
             loose: minimum_interatomic_distance/10.0 \n\
           The default tolerance is the \"tight\" tolerance value. \n\
           A value can also be specified. (Note, it must be below the minimum  \n\
           interatomic distance, otherwise an error will be thrown.) \n\
        Can be called inside aflow via: \n\
              xstructure.SpaceGroup_ITC()        (default tolerance) \n\
              xstructure.SpaceGroup_ITC(tol)     (user defined tolerance) \n\
        AFLOW counterpart to platonSG and findsymSG. \n\
        Magnetic analysis: \n\
          The magnetic tag specifies the magnetic moment on each of the atoms.  The \n\
          two input formats are a comma separated string of the magnetic moments - \n\
          in the same order as the input file, the location of the INCAR, or the location  \n\
          of the OUTCAR, which is then read and the magnetic moment for each atom is found  \n\
          (must be a static calculation, otherwise this information isn't specified). \n\
          Works for both collinear and non-collinear systems (AFLOW autodetects  \n\
          collinear/non-collinear based on the input). \n\
        Options: \n\
          [--no_scan] : Will not perform tolerance scan. \n\
          [--mag|--magnetic|--magmom=[m1,m2,...|INCAR|OUTCAR]]: Perform symmetry analysis of spin system, where spin degree of freedom breaks symmetry  \n\
        Check aflow --readme=symmetry \n\
  \n\
  aflow --alphabetic < POSCAR \n\
        Makes the structure in alphabetic order (if possible). \n\
 \n\
  aflow --alpha_compound=string1,string2,....  \n\
        Makes the alphabetic \"compound\" from the name of string. For instance \n\
        aflow --alpha_compound=Zr15.6Ag2Mg14 \n\
        returns Ag2Mg14Zr15.6 \n\
  aflow --alpha_species=string1,string2,....  \n\
        Makes the alphabetic \"species\" from the name of string. For instance \n\
        aflow --alpha_species=Zr15.6Ag2Mg14 \n\
        returns AgMgZr \n\
 \n\
  aflow --analyze_database \n\
        Outputs the statistics of the AFLOW database file into a JSON file. The \n\
        locations of the files needs to be defined in the .aflow.rc file. \n\
 \n\
  aflow --angle=cutoff < POSCAR   \n\
        Outputs to standard out the angles for each atom triplet \n\
        made up of neighors within a distance cutoff of each other.   \n\
        Actually, since this can be huge, only the first MAX_NUM_ANGLE-1 \n\
        neighbours within d are used.  MAX_NUM_ANGLE=21 at present and \n\
        can be set in aflow_pflow_print.cpp \n\

  aflow --bandgap[=bands_directory1[,bands_directory2,...]] \n\
        Calculates the energy gap and band edges of a material by looking at the occupancies in the OUTCAR file. \n\
        On output it produces the following background system information: \n\
        System      : The system name, identical to the SYSTEM tag in the OUTCAR. \n\
        Spin tag    : Whether it is a spin polarized / unpolarized calculation. \n\
        Fermi level : Obtained from the E-fermi tag in the OUTCAR. \n\
        ----------------------- \n\
        The energy gap (Egap) and band edges (Valence Band Top, VBT, and Conduction Band Bottom, CBB) are then \n\
        output in table format, with 5 signficant figures. \n\

        Special for metallic materials: the edges are arbitrarily set to -1 and the gap is arbitrarily set to \n\
        -1.0E-09. The \"Net Result\" is the overall gap and edges of the system. Note that the band edges have been  \n\
        referenced to the Fermi energy. \n\

        There are several meaningful tags (separated by \"_\") provided under \"Type\", including: \n\
          (half-)metal:     no band gap present in at least one of the spin-channels \n\
          insulator:        band gap present \n\
          (in)/direct:      issued for insulators, specifies whether VBT and CBB come from the same k-point \n\
          zero-gap:         issued for insulators with a negligible gap (tol===1e-4 eV) \n\
          spin-polarized:   issued for spin-polarized insulators where VBT and CBB come from different spin-channels \n\
          empty(-partial):  issued for materials where no band edge is detected for at least a single k-point (OBSOLETE, warning issued now) \n\

        Returns the center, radius and coordination (with atoms number) \n\
        of the cages for interstitial defects (SC Nov07). \n\
        It prints all the cages generated by putting spheres between \n\
        four, three and two points, stable and metastable respectively. \n\
        After finding all the cages (REDUCIBLE) the algorithm removes the \n\
        ones symmetrically equivalent (by using the space group calculated \n\
        at the beginning). The cages that are worth simulating are the \n\
	IRREDUCIBLE ones. \n\
 	  Radius is the radius includeing the scale. \n\
        P is the number of points used to find the sphere. \n\
        C is the coordination of the sphere (the number of atoms on its \n\
        surface, from radius to radius+roughness. \n\
        T is the label of the irreducible cage. You can see in the last \n\
        part of the output the lables of the reduced cages. \n\
        NOTES: If you specify \"--np=NP\", a concurrent number of NP posix \n\
        threads will be started to speed the calculation in a multicpu- \n\

        Converts a surface data file (e.g. CHGCAR file) to a .jvxl file at a specified cutoff. \n\
        You may also specify a downsample ratio.  \n\
        This will reduce the number of points on the surface by the specified factor. \n\
        You may produce multiple .jvxl files in the following ways: \n\

  aflow --chgint CHGCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out the integrated charge density around   \n\
        every atom.  The total integrated density within the Voronoi   \n\
        volume is given for each atom.  The code also calculates   \n\
        the integrated density in a surrounding sphere for each atom.   \n\
        This is output as a function of radius for radii from 0 to 3   \n\
        angstrom in steps of 0.1 angstrom.  The total,Up-Dn,Up,Dn   \n\
        charges are all integrated although for non-spin polarized   \n\
        calculations only the first gives new information. The code \n\
        works on all the recent versions of vasp we have tried but they   \n\
        seem to change the CHGCAR formatting sometimes so it may crash   \n\
        on different versions (at least 4.4.1 and 4.4.5 (including PAW)   \n\

             loose: minimum_interatomic_distance/10.0 \n\
           The default tolerance is the \"tight\" tolerance value. \n\
           A value can also be specified. (Note, it must not be below the minimum \n\
           interatomic distance, otherwise an error will be thrown.) \n\
        Space group setting: \n\
          The space group setting can be specified with the optional flag [--setting=1| =2] (the default is setting 1). \n\
          For rhombohedral systems, setting 1=rhl and 2=hex. \n\

        [--entropic_temperature|--entropictemperature|--entroptemp] : Calculate the Ts \n\
             convex hull (upper-half). Default is Hf hull (lower-half).   \n\

              Calculates the stability criterion of the ground state structure. Will return \n\
              a warning if structure is not a ground state one. It removes the point from the  \n\

              Providing an additional component (e.g., --dist2hull=0.5,0.25,0.1) results in a rigid shift in the energy axis and, \n\
              thus, a constant added to the final distance calculated (0.1 is in units of eV for formation energy hulls). \n\
        [--skip_structure_comparison|--skipstructruecomparison|--skipstructcomp|--ssc] : structure comparison analysis for determination of \n\

  aflow --corners | --corner < POSCAR \n\
        Add to the POSCAR the corner and face atoms so it looks \n\
        good when you plot the unit cell with rasmol/jmol and so on.. \n\
        This option is just for visualization and should not be used \n\
        to transform POSCARS to run. You will get super-imposed atoms! \n\
 \n\
  aflow --data[=tolerance| =tight| =loose] [--no_scan] [--print=txt | --print=json] < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out basic data about the structure in the \n\
        POSCAR input file. Output includes volume, a b c alpha beta gamma, \n\
        reciprocal lattice, reciprocal lattice volume. \n\
        This routine consists of symmetry consistency checks. If symmetry rules are broken, \n\
        the code automatically changes tolerance and recalculates from the beginning. \n\
        Tolerance: \n\
           The tolerance is given in Angstroms.  There are two preset tolerances: \n\
             tight: minimum_interatomic_distance/100.0 \n\
             loose: minimum_interatomic_distance/10.0 \n\
           The default tolerance is the \"tight\" tolerance value. \n\
           A value can also be specified. (Note, it must not be below the minimum \n\
           interatomic distance, otherwise an error will be thrown.) \n\
        Options: \n\
          [--no_scan] : Will not perform tolerance scan. \n\
          [--print=txt | --print=json] : Specify output format. \n\

        Slightly different data is given: No space groups, All bond lengths. \n\
  aflow --data2 < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out basic data about the structure in the \n\
        POSCAR input file. Similar to --data but with another style (SC). \n\
  aflow --debye=THERMO \n\
        Usage:  aflow --debye=THERMO[.bz2|.gz|.xz] \n\
 	  Fits Debye temperature to heat capacity data in THERMO[.bz2|.gz|.xz] file as calculated using APL. \n\
	  Writes results to file debye_temperature.dat and plots results in debye_temperature.png \n\
	  Also calculates value for Debye temperature which best fits all heat capacity data in the range \n\
          given in the THERMO file, and writes this value in the file debye_temperature.dat \n\
    	  See Ascroft & Mermin, Solid State Physics, equation 23.26 for expression for heat capacity in terms of debye temperature. \n\
 	  The following files must reside in DIRECTORY as in the AFLOW written form or as compressed files. \n\
 		THERMO  \n\
		aflow.in \n\
	  The aflow.in file is used to determine the number of atoms per unit cell. \n\
	  If the files are found compressed, the compressed files are preserved and temporary files are written and discarded. \n\
 	  The generation of the THERMO file is controlled by the command \n\
 	      [AFLOW_APL]TP \n\
       See README_APL, especially 3). for more details. \n\
 \n\
  aflow --diff=POSCAR1,POSCAR2 \n\

  \n\
  aflow --disp=cutoff < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out the displacement from each atom to all \n\

     \n\
  aflow --delta_kpoints=number < POSCAR [or --dkpoints=number | -dkpoints=number | -dk=number] \n\
        Gives the k1,k2,k3 so that the delta_kappa is less-equal than \"number\". \n\
        Input dK is the desired smallest distance between grid points in reciprocal space.  \n\
        The smallest mesh to satisfy this requirement is calculated. \n\
        See also --kpoints. \n\
 \n\
  aflow --edata[=tolerance| =tight| =loose] [--setting=1| =2] [--no_scan] [--print=txt | --print=json] < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard the information given by --data in addition \n\
        to lattice-, superlattice- and reciprocal-lattice types. \n\
        This routine consists of symmetry consistency checks. If symmetry rules are broken, \n\
        the code automatically changes tolerance and recalculates from the beginning. \n\
        Tolerance: \n\
           The tolerance is given in Angstroms.  There are two preset tolerances: \n\
             tight: minimum_interatomic_distance/100.0 \n\

           The default tolerance is the \"tight\" tolerance value. \n\
           A value can also be specified. (Note, it must not be below the minimum \n\
           interatomic distance, otherwise an error will be thrown.) \n\
        Space group setting: \n\
          The space group setting can be specified with the optional flag [--setting=1| =2] (the default is setting 1). \n\
          For rhombohedral systems, setting 1=rhl and 2=hex. \n\
          For monoclinic systems, setting 1=unique axis-b and 2=unique axis-c. \n\
        Magnetic analysis: \n\
          The magnetic tag specifies the magnetic moment on each of the atoms.  The \n\
          two input formats are a comma separated string of the magnetic moments - \n\
          in the same order as the input file, the location of the INCAR, or the location \n\
          of the OUTCAR, which is then read and the magnetic moment for each atom is found \n\
          (must be a static calculation, otherwise this information isn't specified). \n\
          Works for both collinear and non-collinear systems (AFLOW autodetects \n\
          collinear/non-collinear based on the input). \n\
        Options: \n\

 \n\
  aflow --eigcurv=bands_directory \n\
        Perform a graph decomposition of the BZ paths found in a BANDS calculation into component vertices and edges. \n\
        These are then organized into a data structure that contains information on the branching associated with each \n\
        edge in the graph. Once this is in place, short walks are performed along these edges and their branches, with \n\
        the purpose of detecting maxima and minima in the band structure, as well as their corresponding curvatures. \n\
        The curvatures are currently calculated using the 5 point central difference approximation, \n\
        f\"(@f3) = (-f1+16f2-30f3+16f4-f5)/(12h^2) \n\
        which has an O(4) error. Note that the curvatures are not reliable, given that angular information is lost in the \n\
        vicinity of the vertices. \n\
 \n\
  aflow --effective-mass | --em directory_name \n\
        Calculate the carrier effective masses. \n\
        If the data is generated by aflow, DOSCAR.static, POSCAR.static, and EIGENVAL.static are used. \n\

 \n\
  aflow --ewald[=eta] < POSCAR \n\
        Finds the electrostatic energy of the POSCAR file using the   \n\
        Ewald sum.  Charges must be entered after each atom position. \n\
        E.g.,   Co 0.00 0.00 0.00 +2.  This is easy to do using the --names   \n\
        option.  Eta is a real space screening parameter.  Setting   \n\
        eta<=0 or leaving it out will cause aflow to choose it   \n\
        automatically (and hopefully optimally).  Eta->0 is no   \n\
        screening and the Ewald recipricol term will be zero.  Eta->inf   \n\
        is total screening and the Ewald real term will be zero.  The   \n\
        Ewald sum itself should always be the same and eta will only   \n\
        affect the efficiency of the calculation. \n\

        Calculates factor group symmetry of the cell {R|t} and writes \n\
        in the aflow.fgroup.out file. See documentation of aflow. \n\
        The point group is required for the factor group, therefore \n\
        the aflow.pgroup.out file will be generated as well. \n\
        This routine consists of symmetry consistency checks. If symmetry rules are broken, \n\
        the code automatically changes tolerance and recalculates from the beginning. \n\
        Tolerance: \n\
           The tolerance is given in Angstroms.  There are two preset tolerances: \n\
             tight: minimum_interatomic_distance/100.0 \n\
             loose: minimum_interatomic_distance/10.0 \n\
           The default tolerance is the \"tight\" tolerance value. \n\
           A value can also be specified. (Note, it must not be below the minimum \n\
           interatomic distance, otherwise an error will be thrown.) \n\

  aflow --aflow-sym|--AFLOW-SYM|--AFLOWSYM|--aflowSYM|--aflowsym|--full_symmetry|--full_sym|--fullsym[=tolerance| =tight| =loose] [--no_scan] [--print=txt | --print=json] [--screen_only] [--mag|--magnetic|--magmom=[m1,m2,...|INCAR|OUTCAR]] < POSCAR \n\
        Calculates the full symmetry of a crystal: point group lattice, point group crystal, factor group, \n\
        space group, site point group, inequivalent/equivalent atoms, and the point group of the klattice. \n\
        This routine calculates the full symmetry suite at a certain tolerance. If symmetry rules are broken, \n\
        the code automatically changes tolerance and recalculates from the beginning. \n\
        Tolerance: \n\
           The tolerance is given in Angstroms.  There are two preset tolerances: \n\
             tight: minimum_interatomic_distance/100.0 \n\
             loose: minimum_interatomic_distance/10.0 \n\
           The default tolerance is the \"tight\" tolerance value. \n\
           A value can also be specified. (Note, it must not be below the minimum  \n\
           interatomic distance, otherwise an error will be thrown.) \n\
        Magnetic analysis: \n\
          The magnetic tag specifies the magnetic moment on each of the atoms.  The \n\
          two input formats are a comma separated string of the magnetic moments - \n\
          in the same order as the input file, the location of the INCAR, or the location \n\
          of the OUTCAR, which is then read and the magnetic moment for each atom is found \n\
          (must be a static calculation, otherwise this information isn't specified). \n\
          Works for both collinear and non-collinear systems (AFLOW autodetects \n\
          collinear/non-collinear based on the input). \n\
        Options: \n\
          [--no_scan] : Will not perform tolerance scan. \n\
          [--print=txt | --print=json] : Specify output format. \n\

 \n\
  aflow --getTEMP[s] [--runstat | --runbar | --refresh=X | --warning_beep=T | --warning_halt=T ] \n\
        If available, the command outputs the hostname and temperatures of the machine. Useful to find hardware issues: \n\
	          with --runstat the command continuously prints the temperature, refreshing every XX refresh seconds; \n\
	          with --runbar the command prints a bar with the temperature, refreshing every XX refresh seconds; \n\
        with --refresh=X you can specify the refresh time (DEFAULT below) \n\
        with --warning_beep=T, if the max temp goes beyond T(C, DEFAULT below), the command beeps the computer speaker; \n\
	          with --warning_halt=T, it the max temp goes beyond T(C, DEFAULT below), the command halts the computer (aflow must be run as root). \n\

      	The file must follow the format of, but not be named All_atomic_environments.dat. \n\
        Check aflow --readme=gfa \n\
 \n\
  aflow --gulp < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out a gulp formatted input file based on \n\
        the POSCAR input file.  The formatting is for a distance \n\
        calculation in gulp.  If you want atom names you must put \n\
        them after each atom position in the POSCAR file (see --names). \n\
        If any names are missing they are defaulted to H. \n\
 \n\
  aflow --hkl=h,k,l[,bond] < POSCAR  \n\
        Returns the planar density and number of broken bonds per unit are \n\
        along the Miller plane (h k l). The calculations returns also \n\
        the bonds broken for each type and all types. \n\
        Note: the indices are with respect to the unit cell, not the \n\
        conventional cell, and the result is in #atoms/A^2 (scale included). \n\
	  BOND: (default BOND_DEF): \n\
        If you specify a \"bond\", all the bonds shorter than \n\
        bond*nearest_neighbour_bond (between all types or combination \n\
        of them) that are cut by the plane will contribute to the broken \n\
        bond density Nb(#/AA). \n\
        NOTE2: the 1st atom is taken to be the origin (all the other atoms \n\
        are shifted). \n\
  aflow --hkl_search[=khlmax[,bond[,step]]] < POSCAR	 \n\
        Returns the planar density and number of broken bonds per unit \n\
        are along the Miller plane (h k l). The calculations returns \n\
        also the bonds broken for each type and all types. \n\
        Note: the indices are with respect to the unit cell, not the \n\
        conventional cell, and the result is in #atoms/A^2 (scale included). \n\
	  Search from -hmax<=h<=hmax, -kmax<=k<=kmax, -lmax<=l<=lmax, where \n\
        the boundaries are (-4,-4,-4) to (4,4,4) unless the HKLMAX is specified. \n\
        HKLMAX: \n\
        If you specify a hklmax, then the search is   \n\
        -hklmax<=h<=hklmax, -hklmax<=k<=hklmax, -hklmax<=l<=hklmax \n\
	  BOND: (default 1.3): \n\
        If you specify a \"bond\", all the bonds shorter than \n\
        bond*nearest_neighbour_bond (between all types or combination \n\
        of them) that are cut by the plane will contribute to the broken \n\
        bond density Nb(#/AA). \n\
	  STEP: (default 1): \n\
        If you specify STEP then the update of h,k,l, is done in steps of step. \n\
  aflow --hkl_search_simple[=cutoff[,bond[,khlmax[,step]]]] < POSCAR	 \n\
  aflow --hkl_search_complete[=cutoff[,bond[,khlmax[,step]]]] < POSCAR	 \n\
        Returns the planar density and number of broken bonds per unit are \n\
        along the Miller plane (h k l). The calculations returns also the bonds \n\
        broken for each type and all types. \n\
        Note: the indices are with respect to the unit cell, not the \n\
        conventional cell, and the result is in #atoms/A^2 (scale included). \n\
        The simple search is fast but it might miss some planes! \n\
	  The complete search should not miss planes but can be very slow! \n\
	  CUTOFF (default 1.3): \n\
        If you specify a cutoff, the command will look for all the \n\
        planes generated with triplets of atoms in a radius cutoff*|a1+a2+a3|. \n\
        The algorithm to find the density of atoms is quite complex, \n\
        and it relies on a sum of four triangles (one triangle v1,v2,v3 \n\
        generated by hkl) plus three triangles generated by adding the v's \n\
        and subtracting one. This guarantees that we span 2 unit cells \"rhombi\" \n\
        in independent directions. The algorithm also plots the number of atoms \n\
        in the radius, so you can choose a decent cutoff'. For bcc/fcc cutoff=1.5 \n\
        usually good. If you do not specify the cutoff, a value of 1.3 is \n\
        take by default. Be careful with the cutoff ! The complexity grows \n\
        as cutoff^3 ! \n\
	  BOND: (default 1.3): \n\
        If you specify a \"bond\", all the bonds shorter than \n\
        bond*nearest_neighbour_bond (between all types or combination \n\
        of them) that are cut by the plane will contribute to the broken \n\
        bond density Nb(#/AA). \n\
        HKLMAX (default \"dims\" given by cutoff) \n\
        If you specify a hklmax, then the search is   \n\
        -hklmax<=h<=hklmax, -hklmax<=k<=hklmax, -hklmax<=l<=hklmax \n\
	  STEP (detault simple: 1 complete 1/12) \n\
        If you specify STEP then the update of h,k,l, is done in steps of step. \n\
	  NOTE1: The algorithm will be implemented in aflow as automatic \n\
        surfaces generation. \n\
        NOTE2: the 1st atom is taken to be the origin (all the other atoms \n\
        are shifted). \n\

  aflow --hnf n < POSCAR \n\
        Given a POSCAR and a volume 'n' (determinant of the Hermite normal form), it \n\
        generates the set of supercells of POSCAR having volume n and being unique. \n\
        In more details: it calculates the HNF matrices, the point group of the POSCAR lattice, \n\
        then reduces the supercells by symmetry and print the unique POSCARs in aflow.in START/STOP format, \n\
        ready for high-throughput calculation. \n\
	      If the volume is chosen negative, then all the supercells with HNF from 2 to -n will be generated \n\
        with the same algorithm. \n\
  aflow --hnftol [eps] < PARTCAR \n\
        Given a PARTCAR, it calculates the HNF size to get the right concentration spread of partial \n\
        occupation within the tolerance. If eps is zero, negative or it is not given, aflow \n\
        takes the tolerance from the PARTCAR, and if this is not available, it takes the default value. PARTCAR example: \n\

  aflow --icsd2aflowin < input.icsd \n\
        Convert input.icsd (ICSD-format) to aflow.in \n\
  aflow --icsd2poscar < input.icsd \n\
        Write output to stdout POSCAR from stdin ICSD-format \n\
  aflow --icsd2proto < input.icsd \n\
        Write output to stdout in ICSD_PROTO-format from stdin ICSD-format \n\
  aflow --icsd2wyck < ternary.icsd \n\
        Write output to file WYCKCAR  (WYCKCAR-format) from stdin ICSD-format \n\
        in this example is streamed in from file \"ternary.icsd\". \n\
        If the input contains multiple compounds, a subfolder will \n\
        be created for each compound using the following folder name template: \n\
            CompoundFormula_ICSD_ICSDid/ \n\
        The ICSDid is the compound id in the original ICSD database. \n\

        (see --icsd2wyck). In this case, all compounds will be processed. \n\
        If partial occupation is detected, the sof will be written as part of \n\

 \n\
  aflow --identical < POSCAR \n\
        Makes all the atoms identical. Useful to find the properties of \n\
        the superlattice. \n\
  aflow --incell < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out a POSCAR file with all \n\
        atoms mapped to their images within the unit cell. \n\
  aflow --incompact < POSCAR \n\
        Similar to --incell \n\
        Outputs to standard out a POSCAR file where all the \n\
        atoms are mapped through the unit and neighbours cells \n\
        to minimixe the shortest possible bond with an adjacent atom \n\
        This option is very useful if you run big and complicate \n\
        molecules where atoms exit of the unit cell and you have \n\
        problems understanding where they are because visualization \n\
        packages do not show bonds anymore ... \n\
        Anyway, it is easier to test than to describe. (SC 6 Aug 04) \n\
  aflow --insphere radius < POSCAR \n\
        Similar to --incell and --incompact \n\
        Outputs in XYZ format (rasmol standard), the \n\
        positions of all the atoms inside a sphere of radius \n\
        \"radius\" centered in the origin. \n\
        If you want another origin, you must shift the atoms first. \n\
        The radius is in cartesian format. (SC 6 Aug 04) \n\
  aflow --intpol=file1,file2,nimages,nearest_image_flag \n\
        Creates nimages image POSCAR files by interpolating linearly \n\
        between structures in file1 and file2.  File1 and file2 \n\
        should both be POSCAR like files with corresponding atoms.   \n\
        The nearest_image_flag is set to 'e' for exact interpolation \n\
        and 'n' or 'N' for nearest-image interpolation.  Exact \n\
        interpolation means that all the positions are taken exactly \n\
        as they are input.  Nearest-image interpolation means that \n\
        the interpolation between two corresponding atoms in file1 \n\
        and file2 is actually done between the atom in file1 and \n\
        the nearest image of the corresponding atom in file2.  This \n\
        is useful, e.g., if the positions (in direct coordinates) \n\
        are 0.01 (file1) and 0.99 (file2).  These are far apart in \n\
        exact interpolation but very close in nearest-image \n\
        interpolation.  The POSCAR output files are numbered and \n\
        output to the present directory.  The code also creates \n\
        numbered subdirectories and copies the appropriate POSCAR \n\
        files into those.  This option makes it easy to set up a rubber \n\
        band calculation in vasp. \n\
  aflow --inwignerseitz [--inws] < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out a POSCAR file where all the atoms are \n\
        mapped to their images in the Wigner-Seitz cell.(SC 10Jan04) \n\
  aflow --inflate_lattice=coefficient | --ilattice coefficient=coefficient < POSCAR \n\
        Inflate/deflate POSCAR lattice of coefficient. \n\
  aflow --inflate_volume=coefficient | --ivolume coefficient=coefficient < POSCAR \n\
        Inflate/deflate POSCAR lattice of coefficient. \n\
  aflow --kpath [--grid=XX] < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to stdout a KPOINTS in line mode useful for bandstructure \n\
        calculations. The k-points path is chosen to cover all possible \n\
        pair combinations of special k-points in the irreducible BZ (IRBZ). \n\
        a special k-point is either: \n\
        (1) a center of a face in IRBZ, or \n\
        (2) a corner of IRBZ, or \n\
        (3) a midpoint (say M) of a line-edge (say AB) IF the Gamma-M-A makes a 90 degrees angle. \n\
        The coordinates are given in fractionals of the k-vectors, in which \n\
        derived from the \"standard\" lattice used in AFLOW. \n\
        To find out the standard lattice of the POSCAR, use --sp option. \n\
        Optional: --grid=XX specifies the density of the grid, if not specified it takes --grid=16. \n\
        NOTE. If grid is negative real number, e.g. --grid=-0.01, then its value is taken  \n\
        as the deltaK during the path which is constructed as uniformly as possible in the k-space. \n\
        The option works both for VASP, QE style mode inputs (ABINIT and AIMS in the future). \n\
        Example: aflow --proto=3:Ag:Zr [--qe | --abinit | --aims] | aflow --kpath=-0.01 \n\
 \n\
  aflow --kpoints=KDENS [or --kppra=KDENS,-k=KDENS] < POSCAR  \n\
        This funtion prints a set of Monkhorst-Pack kpoint mesh values \n\
        (divisions along each reciprical lattice parameter) \n\
        based on the desired KDENS density and the \n\
        lattice parameters.  The values assure the most even \n\
        distribution of KDENS along the lattice params consistent \n\
        with the kpt density. See --delta_kpoints \n\
 \n\
  aflow --jmol[=n1[,n2[,n3[,color[,true/false]]]]] < POSCAR \n\
        Similar to --xyz. Starts jmol (must be available) with a file \n\
        based on the POSCAR input file. If you want to use atom names \n\
        you must put them after each atom  position in the POSCAR \n\
        file (see --names). If any names are missing they are defaulted to H. \n\
        If no numbers are specified, aflow takes \"1,1,1\". (SC/Dec09) \n\
        Background color may be chosen (e.g., white, brown, beige, etc...). \n\
        Default background color is white. The flag \"true\" specifies that the \n\
        cif file is to be saved. Default is \"false.\" (RHT/Mar11) \n\
 \n\
  aflow --jmolanimation | --animation | --print=gif [gif_file] < POSCAR \n\
        Generate animated gif file of rotated structure from POSCAR by using \n\
        jmol and ImageMagick. If no output gif file name is given, the default name \n\
        \"aninamtion_\" + process id + \".gif\" will be used. The setting parameters \n\
        of jmol cannot be changed by users currently. \n\
        User must have valid DISPLAY for jmol to open its window and \"Convert\" \n\
        command is used to generate multi-gif by combining gif files generated by jmol. \n\
         \n\
 \n\
  aflow --join_strlist strlist1 strlist2 \n\
        Outputs to standard out a sequence of structures in POSCAR format. \n\
        The structures consist of those in strlist1 with the atoms from   \n\
        strlist2 added in.  The positions are taken from strlist2,   \n\
        transformed into Cartesian coordinates, and then inserted into \n\
        strlist1.  All inserted atoms are added as new types.  If one \n\
        file has more structures than the other then the shorter file \n\
        is padded with copies of the last structure.  For more information \n\
        on a strlist see --make_strlist. \n\
 \n\
  aflow --kband ispin \n\
        ispin(1=nospin,2=spin). Outputs to standard out Eband vs K for band structure plot. \n\
        Needs EIGENVAL and KPOINTS files. Format: \n\
        Kpoint upEband1 upEband2...upEbandN downEband1 downEband2...downEbandN \n\
        The Kpoint column is constructed by cascading each KPOINT-segment specified in KPOINT file. \n\
 \n\
  aflow --latticereduction | -latreduction POSCAR \n\
        Lattice Reduction to Max Orthogonality (Minkowski) and then \n\
        to Niggly Form. This procedure has been shown to give the best \n\
        unit cell for the lattice in terms of Minkowski optimization and \n\
        most symmetric representation.  For the bcc and fcc it gives the \n\
        standard, most symmetric, unit vectors. \n\
        It also helps in the primitive cell serach, as it has been \n\
        included by default inside. (SC0902). \n\
   \n\
  aflow --lattice_type | --lattice | --lattice_crystal < POSCAR \n\
        Returns the lattice type and the conventional lattice type of the CRYSTAL following the tables \n\
        Check aflow --readme=symmetry \n\
  aflow --lattice_lattice_type | --lattice_lattice < POSCAR \n\
        Returns the lattice type and the conventional lattice type of the LATTICE following the tables \n\
        Check aflow --readme=symmetry \n\
  aflow --latticehistogram < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs the lattice calculated respect to tolerance of histogram of symmetry. \n\
     \n\
  aflow --unique_atom_decorations [GENERAL_COMPARISON_OPTIONS] < file \n\
      Determines the unique and duplicate atom decorations for a given structure, grouping  \n\
      equivalent decorations (if applicable). \n\
       \n\
      [GENERAL_COMPARISON_OPTIONS]: \n\
        [--np=16|--num_proc=16] : Allocate the number of processors/threads for the task. \n\
        [--optimize_match] : Explore all lattice and origin choices to find the best matching representation, i.e., minimizes misfit value. \n\
        [--no_scale_volume] : Suppresses volume rescaling during structure matching; identifies differences due to volume expansion or compression of a structure. \n\
        [--ignore_symmetry] : Neglects symmetry analysis (both space group and Wyckoff positions) for grouping comparisons. \n\
        [--ignore_Wyckoff] : Neglects Wyckoff symmetry (site symmetry) for filtering comparisons, but considers the space group number. \n\
        [--ignore_environment] : Neglects LFA environment analysis for filtering comparisons. \n\
        [--print=TEXT|JSON] : For comparing multiple structures, the results printed to the relevant files are formatted into human-readable  \n\
          text or JSON, respectively.  By default, AFLOW-XtalMatch writes the output in both formats. \n\
        [--quiet|--q] : Suppresses the log information for the comparisons. \n\
        [--screen_only] : Prints the comparison results to the screen and does not write to any files. \n\
        Check aflow --readme=compare \n\
 \n\
  aflow --use_LOCK=XXX \n\
        Uses XXX instead of \"LOCK\" in freezing/searching/operating directories. \n\
        The option is very useful for compounded calculations. \n\
 \n\
  aflow --ltcell=a11,a12,a13,a21,a22,a23,a31,a32,a33 < POSCAR \n\
  aflow --ltcell=a11,a22,a33 < POSCAR \n\
  aflow --ltcell=file < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out the linear tranform of the input \n\
        POSCAR file.  This simpy multiplies cell parameters and \n\
        atom positions by the 3x3 matrix values.  This can \n\
        be used to rotate the cell, swap x and y coordinates, etc. \n\
        This cannot create a supercell (see --supercell for that). \n\
        The nine numbers must be separated spaces, and they form the \n\
        nine elements a11,a12,a13,a21,a22,a23,a31,a32,a33 of the 3x3 \n\
        supercell matrix, respectively. If you specify only 3 numbers, \n\
        the other six are taken zero. If you use the \"file\" syntax, \n\
        nine numbers are read from file. They can be on one or \n\
        multiple lines. New algorithm by SC (aug07). \n\
        The new lattice is (by column) (a1 a2 a3)*=LT*(a1 a2 a3). \n\
  aflow --ltcellfv=v1,v2,v3,phi < POSCAR   \n\
        Rotates the lattice vectors and atoms by angle phi (in degrees) \n\
        around vector (v1,v2,v3).  Outputs to standard out the new \n\
        POSCAR.  This can be used to rotate the cell, swap x and y \n\
        coordinates, etc.  \n\
 \n\
  aflow --magpara=directory | --magpara (./) \n\
        Output shows the magnetic momentum, cell of volume and spin polarization around Fermi level. \n\
        If a directory is not specified, it loads \"./\" \n\
        EXAMPLE: aflow --magpara \n\
                 MAGNETIC MOMENTUM CELL : 2.74234 \n\

 \n\
  aflow --slab=h,k,l[,#filled_layers[,#vacuum layers]] < POSCAR \n\
  	Produces a slab unit cell in POSCAR format. The normal of the slab is specified \n\
        by the Miller indices of the orthogonal plane. Thus, make sure you know how the original POSCAR is specified. \n\
        For example, (100) is not what you think for fcc primitive. \n\
        Each point (hkl) in the reciprocal lattice \n\
        corresponds to a set of lattice planes (hkl) in the real space lattice. \n\
        The reciprocal lattice vector points in a direction normal to the real space planes.       \n\
 \n\
  aflow --make_strlist OUTCAR XDATCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out a sequence of structures in POSCAR format. \n\
        The strlist file created contains a list of structures, each   \n\
        formatted exactly like a POSCAR file, with an empty line after   \n\
        all but the last one.  The file must have no extra lines at the end \n\
        or all routines that read it will crash.  The lattice parameters   \n\
        are pulled out from the OUTCAR and the positions from XDATCAR.   \n\
        If OUTCAR has too few lattice parameters then copies of the last   \n\
        set are used for the remaining XDATCAR. \n\
  aflow --maxatoms=N | --max_atoms=N | --atoms_max=N | --atomsmax=N < POSCAR \n\
        Limits the input POSCAR to N atoms (it writes an error if atoms>N). \n\
        This is an useful option for online wrappers. \n\
  aflow --minkowski_basis_reduction | --minkowski | --mink < POSCAR \n\
        Converts the unit cell with the Minkowski reduction \n\
        This routine takes a set of basis vectors (that form a lattice) \n\
        and reduces them so that they form the shortest possible basis. \n\
        The reduction is performed so that each vector \"a_i\" is a close \n\
        as possible to the origin while remaining in the affine plane which \n\
        is defined by \"a_j\", \"a_k\" but shifted by \"a_i\", for any choice \n\
        of even permutations of i,j,k in 1,2,3. \n\

  aflow --miscibility | --mix strings .. \n\
        Tells if in the library the system (on of the strings) was found \n\
        to be miscible, immiscible or unknown. \n\
        aflow --mix AgMg \n\
        returns AgMg MISCIBILITY_SYSTEM_MISCIBLE \n\
  aflow --mom < POSCAR   \n\
        Gets the mass moments of the POSCAR file.  Gets only the first \n\
        (center of mass) at this point. The scale is used in the \n\
        calculation. \n\
  aflow --msi < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out a msi file based on the POSCAR input \n\
        file.  This can be used as input for cerius. \n\
        In the functions that output the msi format I do something \n\
        to put the lattice vectors in a form that cerius2 can read \n\
        happily.  It involvs making the third lattice vector parallel \n\
        to Z, the second once in the YZ plane, and the letting the \n\
        first lattice vector have all 3 components.  It is confusing \n\
        and probably done in a silly manner, but it seems to work. \n\
        If you want atom names you must put them after each atom \n\
        position in the POSCAR file (see -names).  If any names are \n\
        missing they are defaulted to H.  For an msi file one \n\
        needs the atomic numbers.  These are coded into the \n\
        program for most atoms.  If you use atoms with atomic numbers \n\
        over 86 or f-electron atoms (Lanthanides and Actinides) then \n\
        you will have to increase the database.  For the list of all \n\
        coded atomic numbers see the constructor for the structure \n\
        class in structure.cc. \n\
  \n\
  aflow --names A1 A2 ... < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out a POSCAR file with names \n\
        A1,A2, ... after the atom positions.  Each name \n\
        Ai is assigned to all atoms of type i. \n\
  \n\
  aflow --natoms | --numatoms < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out the number of atoms in the POSCAR. \n\
        Useful for scripting. (SC0902). \n\
  aflow --nbondxx< POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out the nearest neighbor distances between all types of atoms in the POSCAR. \n\
        Useful for scripting. (CO1017). \n\
  aflow --nanoparticle radius distance < POSCAR \n\
        Starting from the input poscar, aflow prints a nanoparticle \n\
        POSCAR with the radius and appropriate lattice making the \n\
        particles as far as \"at least distance\". The origin of the \n\
        particle is taken to be point 0,0,0 in the unit cell. \n\
        You can translate the origin before with the command --setorigin (see below) \n\
        to an atom, a point in cartesian or fractional coordinates. \n\
        The radius and distance are in Angstroms and not scale \n\
        normalized (all scales are set to 1.0). \n\
        If not specified the parameters are taken to be 10A. (SC Apr/08) \n\
  aflow --ndata < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard output the following normalized data: \n\
        a1 a2 a3 phi(a2,a3) phi(a3,a1) phi(a1,a2) \n\
        a1,a2,a3 are NORMALIZED over V^1/3 and phi are in degrees. \n\
  aflow --niggli POSCAR \n\
        Converts the unit cell to the standardized Niggli form.  The \n\
        form is unique (up to some signs, I think).  The transformation \n\
        makes use of only the lattice vectors and does not depend on the \n\
        basis atoms.  This will work on any cell, but it treats the given \n\
        cell as primitive, and it will not reduce the cell to primitive \n\
        if it is not primitive already.  At present the algorithm seems to \n\
        hang if I force more than about 6 digits of accuracy so be aware that \n\
        small errors might be introduced (these can break symmetry!). \n\
  aflow --nn < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out the nearest neighbour distance. \n\
  aflow --noorderparameter < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out a POSCAR without all the order parameter \n\
        stuff in it. (SC0903). \n\
  aflow --nosd < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out a POSCAR without selective dynamics \n\
        formatting.  Combined with the above --sd option this allows \n\
        easy movement between POSCAR files with and without selective \n\
        dynamics formatting. \n\
  aflow --numnames A1 A2 ... < POSCAR \n\
        Same as names except appends an increasing integer to \n\
        each different atom type.  Starts counting at 1 again \n\
        for each new atom type. \n\
  aflow --nspecies | --numspecies < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out the number of species in the POSCAR. \n\
        Useful for scripting. (SC0902). \n\
 \n\
  aflow --OrthoDefect < POSCAR \n\
        Computes the orthogonality defect of the lattice of POSCAR.  \n\
        The orthogonality defect is defined as the ratio of the product of \n\
        lattice vector magnitudes to the volume of the parallelpiped defined  \n\
        by the lattice vectors. So, for three orthogonal vectors, this ratio  \n\
        would be unity. (R. Taylor). \n\
 \n\
  aflow --pdb < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out a protein database (PDB) format file \n\
        based on the POSCAR input file.  This can be used as input \n\
        for many viewing programs.  Note that I don't really know \n\
        anything about PDB but it seems to be an annoyingly column \n\
        formatted.  Therefore, all the widths I use must tbe kept as is.   \n\
        This means that if we have width W for variable X, and prec P, \n\
        then X takes up P+1 for for the decimal part and decimal point, \n\
        and we have only R=W-(P+1)-1=W-P-2 remaining digits (the -1 is \n\
        because if X takes up all of W then you run into the previous \n\
        field).  So we have the constraints \n\
        Cell vectors: W=9,P=3,R=4 => <=10^5 \n\
        Cell angles: W=7,P=2,R=3 => <=10^3 (which always works since \n\
             angles are given as >=0 and <=360) \n\
        Cartesian positions: W=12,8,P=3,R=7,3 => <=10^8,10^4 (>0) \n\
              and <=10^7,10^3 (<0 since you need a space for the -- sign) \n\
        This is all probably fine unless an atom makes it to more \n\
        negative than -999.999. \n\
  aflow --pdos pdos.in PROOUT \n\
        Writes the projected DOS for any desired combination of atoms, \n\
        kpoints, bands, and lm values.  The output consists of 6   \n\
        columns, spin up, down, up-down, and the cumulative DOS for   \n\
        each of those.  Only up spin data is given for non   \n\
        spin-polarized calculations.  The PDOS should look like \n\
        an equivalent vasp output but will not be identical since \n\
        vasp uses a different smearing method to get the PDOS.   \n\
        However, I think these PDOS are basically correct, at least \n\
        qualitatively.  To make this work you must \n\
           -- Use slightly altered version of vasp \n\
           -- set LORBIT=2 in INCAR \n\
           -- Set ISYM=0 in INCAR   \n\
           -- Set RWIGS in INCAR (see below) \n\
        The details explaining all this are given above in the --pocc   \n\
        section.  The input file has the following format \n\
         \n\
           # Input for aflow --pdos.   \n\
           \n\
           # These values you supply once. \n\
           EMIN = --20.01477264 # default: 0.5eV below lowest energy. \n\
           EMAX = 6.90250559 # default: 0.5ev above highest energy. \n\
           NBINS = 300 # default: 300 \n\
           SMOOTH_SIGMA = 0.1 # Gaussian smoothing of the DOS. \n\
                              # default: 1 bin width. \n\
           PRINT_PARAMS = 1 # 0=prints only data (easy to plot). \n\
                               # 1=prints all the input parameters. \n\
                            # default: 0 \n\
           \n\
           # You can have as many cases as you want. \n\
           # They are all added together. \n\
             \n\
           # case 1 \n\
           ATOMS = 1 # default: all atoms. \n\
           KPOINTS = # default: all kpoints.   \n\
           BANDS = # default: all bands. \n\
           LMVALUES = # default: all s,p,d,f. \n\
             \n\
           # case 1 \n\
           ATOMS = 2 # default: all atoms. \n\
           KPOINTS = 1 2 3 # default: all kpoints.   \n\
           BANDS = 1 # default: all bands. \n\
           LMVALUES = 3 # default: all s,p,d,f. \n\
         \n\
        All # denote comment lines.  Each case is started when the token \n\
        ATOMS is used.  Following an ATOMS token, all KPOINTS, BANDS,   \n\
        LMVALUES tokens will apply to the atoms denoted in the preceeding   \n\
        ATOMS token until the next ATOM token.  The  KPOINTS, BANDS,   \n\
        LMVALUES tokens can be left out in which case their default values   \n\
        will be used.  You can have any number of cases.  The above   \n\
        example will calculate a PDOS with projections onto atom 1 \n\
        for all kpoints, bands, and s,p,d, and f (case 1) added to the \n\
        projection onto atom 2 for kpoints 1-3, band 1, and the Pz orbital. \n\
        I believe you can create any desired projections with this input \n\
        file.  The LMVALUES use the following correspondence between   \n\
        numerical input and orbitals projected. \n\
         \n\
        Input number: 1 2  3  4  5    6   7   8   9   10     11     \n\
        Orbitals:     S Py Pz Px Ptot Dxy Dyz Dz2 Dxz Dx2-y2 Dtot \n\
        Input number: 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19   20 \n\
        Orbitals:     F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 F7 Ftot Tot \n\
         \n\
        I have not done the work to figure out which of the standard \n\
        f-orbital functions correspond to F1-F7.   \n\
         \n\
        This is only tested for version 4.4.5. \n\
 \n\
  aflow --pearson_symbol | --pearson < POSCAR \n\
        Returns the Pearson symbol of the structure. \n\
        Check aflow --readme=symmetry \n\
 \n\
  aflow --planedens dens2d.in CHGCAR \n\
        This finds the charge density in a plane.  The input file dens2d.in   \n\
        has the form \n\
           D # Coordinates for following points (Direct/Cartesian) \n\
           scale # Scale factor - edges of plane get mult. by this (but not origin). \n\
           x y z # origin point \n\
           x y z # X axis \n\
           x y z # Y axis \n\
           Nx Ny # Number of X and Y grid points \n\
           Middle # Location for origin (Middle/Corner). \n\
           Ortho # Whether to use Y orthogonal to X (Ortho/Strict). \n\
        The output consists of 4 files, dens.[tot/diff/up/dn].out.  Each   \n\
        has the same format, consisting of rows of density values, each   \n\
        row corresponding to a value along the X axis and each column \n\
        to a value along the Y axis.  The format can be read directly   \n\
        into Excel and easily into MatLab.  This routine uses the same   \n\
        routine as --chgint to read in the CHGCAR and should work \n\
        for the same versions of vasp (see --chgint for more information). \n\
  aflow --platon[=EQUAL | EXACT][,ang,d1,d2,d3] < POSCAR \n\
        This finds the space group.  aflow is creating an output \n\
        file, which is piped into a script platonSG, which uses the \n\
        program platon. \n\
        Wraps input file for Platon ADDSYM package: \n\
        CALC ADDSYM (EQUAL) (EXACT) (ang d1 d2 d3) \n\
        where: \n\
        EQUAL - Search with all atom type treated as equivalent. \n\
        EXACT - All atoms should fit for given criteria. \n\
        ang - Angle criterium in search for metrical symmetry of the \n\
              lattice (default 1.0 degree). \n\
        d1 - Distance criterium for coinciding atoms for non-inversion \n\
             (pseudo)symmetry elements (default 0.25 Angstrom). \n\
        d2 - Distance criterium for coinciding atoms for (pseudo) \n\
             inversion symmetry (default 0.25 Angstrom). \n\
        d3 - Distance criterium for coinciding atoms for (pseudo) \n\
             translation symmetry (default 0.25 Angstrom). \n\
        The defaults are specified in aflow_xatom.cpp as \n\
         #define PLATON_TOLERANCE_ANGLE 1.0 \n\
         #define PLATON_TOLERANCE_D1 0.25 \n\
         #define PLATON_TOLERANCE_D2 0.25 \n\
         #define PLATON_TOLERANCE_D3 0.25 \n\
        To get the space group, type \n\
           aflow -platon < POSCAR | platonSG \n\
        To just get see the output file from aflow, type \n\
           aflow -platon < POSCAR \n\
        To check for errors and see output from platon, type \n\
           aflow -platon < POSCAR | platon -o \n\
        Note that the added flags above do not seem to work.  To change tolerance \n\
        create output file from aflow, and then add the four tolerances \n\
        after CALC ADDSYM (on the same line).  Then pipe this file to platonSG. \n\
        Aflow will use your atom labels if they are there.  If you \n\
        give no atom labels it will use defaults for each atom type, \n\
        (these are He,Li,Be,B,C, and then W for all remaining atom types). \n\
        WARNING: If you have more than 6 atom types the W default \n\
        will give the wrong space group. The equal flag may not work. \n\
        Atoms labeled with H do not get read by default in platon. \n\
        Do not use H labels. \n\
        Note: it works with platon.f and xdrvr.c > 51108 \n\
        platon must be accessible on the path !	   \n\
  aflow --platonSG[=EQUAL | EXACT][,ang,d1,d2,d3] < POSCAR \n\
        This prints out the space group without bothering with the wrap ups. \n\
        Note: it works with platon.f and xdrvr.c > 51108 \n\
        platon must be accessible on the path !	   \n\
  aflow --platonSG_label[=EQUAL | EXACT][,ang,d1,d2,d3] < POSCAR \n\
        Same as above but prints ONLY the space group name.	   \n\
  aflow --platonSG_number[=EQUAL | EXACT][,ang,d1,d2,d3] < POSCAR \n\
        Same as above but prints ONLY the space group number.	   \n\

  aflow --pocc PROOUT \n\
  aflow --pocc PROOUT \n\
        Outputs occupations calculated from projections onto spherical   \n\
        harmonics for each ion for many combinations of L, M, bands,   \n\
        and kpoints.  This works with version 445 and has not been tested   \n\
        on any other version (and probably won't work).  To make this work \n\
        you need to do the following \n\
           -- Use slightly altered version of vasp (see below) \n\
           -- set LORBIT=2 in INCAR (see below) \n\
           -- Set ISYM=0 in INCAR (see below) \n\
           -- Set RWIGS in INCAR (see below) \n\
        Here is why you need to do these things (feel free to skip this). \n\
        The --pocc option reads the PROOUT file, which is produced by   \n\
        running vasp with LORBIT=2 in the INCAR file.  There is an   \n\
        annoying subtle point here. I am not sure I totally get this   \n\
        but here is my best understanding.  The projection onto the   \n\
        spherical harmonics actually uses some atomic like radial   \n\
        functions (bessel functions).  This means that for each   \n\
        spherical harmonic there are multiple states, corresponding   \n\
        to different atomic energy levels and radial functions.   \n\
        Write the projection of band n, at kpt k, onto spherical harmonic   \n\
        with angular quantum numbers l,m and energy level e as Pnklme.   \n\
        As compiled, the vasp code outputs projections Pnklm, summing   \n\
        over the e parameter.  This makes each projection a sum of   \n\
        complex numbers, allowing some cancellations.  However, for   \n\
        occupations, like those output in PROCAR (LORBIT=1) and OUTCAR,   \n\
        the summations over e are done with the squares of the Pnklme.   \n\
        This makes sense, since you want to add up probabilities,   \n\
        not amplitudes, to get an occupation.  Unfortunately, from   \n\
        the output Pnklm one cannot reconstruct the Pnklme, so the   \n\
        ouptut in PROOUT is not enough to reproduce the occupations. \n\
        Therefore, I suggest the following.  Recompile vasp with following \n\
        modifications to sphpro.F \n\
        change line 252 \n\
                   WRITE(IUP,'(9F12.6)') CSUM_PHASE \n\
        to \n\
                   write(IUP,'(9F12.6)') CSUM_ABS \n\
        CSUM_ABS is a complex variable but the imaginary part is zero.  It \n\
        is the squared amplitude for each projection.  Note that this is   \n\
        a probability.  You use it directly (do not square it) to get   \n\
        occupations.  Note that the augmentations are added to this real   \n\
        number, and are therefore probablities, not amplitudes.   \n\
        This makes sense when you look at the code in sphpro.F that   \n\
        calculates the augmentation portion.  The augmentations can be   \n\
        <0, which I assume corresponds to reducing the probability of   \n\
        finding electrons.  This make me a little uncomfortable but   \n\
        I guess it is OK.  At this point the aflow code assumes   \n\
        the above modification and uses the magnitude of the projections \n\
        to calculate all occupations (not the magnitude squared).   \n\
          Also, there is another subtle point with the kpoints.  If   \n\
        you use symmetry certain sets of symmetry equivalent kpoints   \n\
        (a star) are represented by a single irreducible kpoint.  We   \n\
        are used to ignoring this and simply weighting things associated   \n\
        with the irreducible kpoint appropriately to account for the   \n\
        whole star.  However, the projections onto different orbitals   \n\
        are not the same for all the points in a star.  For example,   \n\
        the kpoints (0.1,0,0),(0,0.1,0),(0,0,0.1) may all be in the   \n\
        same star in fcc, but states associated with them will project   \n\
        differently onto Px orbitals.  Therefore, if you use irreducible \n\
        kpoints you will get the wrong projections (it seems like you \n\
        do get the right totals for S,P, and D, bit I am not sure that   \n\
        is always the case).  To be safe, don't use any symmetry -- i.e., \n\
        set ISYM=0 in the INCAR file. \n\
          You must set RWIGS so that the code knows the radius of \n\
        the spheres onto which it projects.   \n\
          To make sure all is in order you can look at the total   \n\
        occupations for each ion in OUTCAR.  These should match   \n\
        the Occupations vs. ION:LM values in the output of aflow   \n\
        (the last lines in the output).  A more detailed check is   \n\
        to run vasp with LORBIT=1 and compare the PROCAR file with   \n\
        the output of aflow.  I am not sure that this will all   \n\
        work the same way with PAW potentials.   \n\

 \n\
        Modify the header of a CHGCAR file so it can be read by Jmol. \n\
        Jmol requires species to be specified in the comment line of the CHGCAR file (first line). \n\
        This code requires an OUTCAR to read in the species. \n\
        Unless specified, it will first look for OUTCAR file in the directory of the CHGCAR, then it will \n\
        look in the directory from which the command is called.  \n\
        The CHGCAR and OUTCAR files may be compressed, and the edited CHGCAR file can be recompressed  \n\
        (if it was previously) by specifying the --zip command. \n\
   \n\
  aflow --prim < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out a POSCAR file with a \n\
        primitive unit cell.  In the primitive cell finding \n\
        function I look for a primitive cell by considering \n\
        as candidate cell vectors every possible triad of 3 \n\
        vectors that can be made from the original cell vectors \n\
        or the basis vectors which translate the lattice onto \n\
        itself.  I then take the triad with the smallest volume \n\
        to be the primitive cell.  If there are multiple \n\
        candidates I take the ones with the largest projections \n\
        onto the original lattice vectors.  See the rouinte \n\

  aflow --rasmol[=n1[,n2[,n3]]] < POSCAR \n\
        Similar to --xyz. Starts rasmol (must be available) with a file \n\

        you must put them after each atom  position in the POSCAR \n\
        file (see -names). If any names are missing they are defaulted to H. \n\
        If no numbers are specified, aflow takes \"1 1 1\". (SC/OCT07,OCT14) \n\
  aflow --raytrace rtfile \n\
        Outputs jpeg or mpeg pictures created by ray tracing.  This   \n\
        is a rather elaborate routine.  The basic idea is that it \n\
        takes as input a list of structures (in POSCAR like format)   \n\
        and converts them into a dat file, inputs that into the ray   \n\
        tracing program tachyon, then takes the tga file output by   \n\
        tachyon and uses convert to make it a jpeg, then if needed   \n\
        takes all the jpegs and puts them together into and mpg using   \n\
        mpeg_encoder.  Therefore the following programs must be   \n\
        installed and in your path: tachyon, convert, mpeg_encoder   \n\
        (only if making a movie).  There is an input file rtfile   \n\
        which contains tokens setting characteristics of the calculation \n\
        and the ray traced picture.  This input file looks like the   \n\
        following:           \n\

        Tokens can be in any order, whitespace is ignored, and anything \n\
        following a # on a line is ignored.  The CENTER, VIEDDIR, and   \n\

        so they have fairly elaborate defaults that seem to usually work   \n\
        fine.  The other values are not bad places to start.  For   \n\
        more info about these check out the tachyon documentation. \n\

        For a single structure the output consists of XXX.dat, XXX.tga, \n\
        XXX.jpg, XXX.enc, XXX.mpg.  Having all these files is useful   \n\
        if some part of the program did not exectute properly and you   \n\
        need to do steps by hand (tachyon XXX.dat produces XXX.tga,   \n\
        convert XXX.tga XXX.jpg produces XXX.jpg, and mpeg_encode XXX.enc \n\
        produces XXX.mpg).  For more than one structure the XXX.dat   \n\
        and XXX.tga files are erased to avoid clutter.  The XXX.enc file   \n\
        is used for the mpeg_encode programs and is totally set in   \n\
        aflow and the user has not control over it from the rtfile.   \n\
        If you want to alter it after it is output go ahead but I know   \n\
        almost nothing about how it works.  To make your own mpg from   \n\
        the jpg type:      mpeg_encode XXX.enc   \n\
        The tga, jpg files  can be viewed with xv and the mpg with mpeg_play.XXX \n\
        Note: this routine was written by Dane and readapted by Stefano. \n\
        It might not work but require slightly modifications in the C++ source. \n\
	  LINUX: Debian 4.0r1 contains convert (\"imagemagick\") and \n\
	         the mpeg_encoder (\"ucbmpeg\"). \n\
  aflow --rbanal nim nearest_image_flag \n\
        This is meant to allow you to analyse a rubber band calculation \n\
        to get energy vs. distance along activation path. The distance \n\
        is given a cumulative from the 00 to END images (a line integral), \n\
        and also as the total distance from 00 and END for each image. \n\
        The first is the activation path, the others are for double checking. \n\
        The rubber band run must have had nim images.  The distance   \n\
        between two images is defined to be the square root of the   \n\
        sum of all the squared distances between all the atoms in the   \n\
        two images.  The distances depend on the   \n\
        setting of nearest_image_flag (see --intpol).  The code works   \n\
        in two steps.  First it gets energies and distances from the   \n\
        OSZICAR and POSCAR/CONTCAR files, respectively.  This   \n\
        requires that it be run in the directory above all the image   \n\
        directories.  The distances are obtained from POSCAR files   \n\
        for the first and last images, which are not actually calculated \n\
        so now CONTCAR files exists.  For imtermediate images the \n\
        POSCAR files are used.  The energies are pulled from the \n\
        OSZICAR files.  First, these do not exist in the first and   \n\
        last image directories, so you must put them their yourself \n\
        based on other runs (if you leave them out then no energies \n\
        will be obtained but you can add the energies later, as described \n\
        below).  Second, the output format for OSZICAR in a parallel \n\
        vasp rubber band run is all messed up.  Therefore, the energies \n\
        are not E0 values (which are not the energy values of the   \n\
        images) but the free energy from the line just before the   \n\
        last E0.  This numbers differ somewhat from E0 values.  This \n\
        whole output formatting problem changes with version of vasp --   \n\
        I set  it up for version 4.4.1 beta.  It should also work with \n\
        v 454.   We should change it to use E0 as soon as possible.   \n\
        Once the distances and energies have been obtained then they   \n\
        are interpolated with a cubic spline curve.  The spline   \n\
        interpolation assumes that the derivatives at the end points   \n\
        are 0.  The E.vs.dist data and the spline interpolation are   \n\
        both output to standard out.  If there is any problem with   \n\
        the energy data (e.g., you need to add end members) then   \n\
        you can fix it and run the spline interpolation again   \n\
        independently (see --spline).  The spline interpolation is   \n\
        done on 50 points by default.  This can be   \n\
        changed by setting DEFAULT_NPT_FOR_SPLINE in aflow_pflow_funcs.cpp. \n\
  aflow --rbdist POSCAR1 POSCAR2 n|N|e|E   \n\
        Gets the distance between two POSCAR files.  Uses lattice params   \n\
        of POSCAR1.  For use of n|N|e|E see --intpol. \n\
  aflow --rdf[=rmax[,nbins[,sigma]]] < POSCAR \n\
        Get the radial distribution function (rdf) for a POSCAR file \n\
        rmax: The radius out to which the rdf is calculated. \n\
        nbins:  The number of bins for the rdf. \n\
        sigma:  The sigma of the gaussian used to smear the rdf. \n\
        This also finds the nearest-nieghbor shells by looking at   \n\
        where the rdf has minima.  The output gives the rdf and nn shells \n\
        for each atom and for each type of neighbour, including a sum \n\
        of all neighbour types.  If you want to treat all atoms as the   \n\
        same (e.g., to look at the parent lattice) just set one \n\
        type in the POSCAR file.  You may need to play with sigma \n\
        and the nbins to get atoms grouped together that you want in   \n\
        one shell but not to group atoms you want in different shells. \n\
        One apporach is to choose enough bins to make sure to distinguish \n\
        every shell of interest and the increase sigma until you group \n\
        desired atoms together. \n\
        rmax default = 5 \n\
        nbins default = 25 \n\
        sigma default = 0 (zero does no smearing). \n\
  aflow --rdfcmp=rmax,nbins,sigma,nshmax,POSCAR1,POSCAR2 \n\
        Uses the radial distribution functions (rdf) for POSCAR 1 and 2   \n\
        to assess how close the structures are.  For each atom the \n\
        rdf and radial shell function (rsf - this gives the coordination \n\
        numbers for each shell) are found for each type.   \n\
        The shells are found by looking at the derivatives of the rdf. \n\
        Then the atoms of the same types are compared and the rms   \n\
        errors in the rsf for POSCAR1 and POSCAR2 are computed.  Then   \n\
        we step through the atoms of POSCAR1, matching them up   \n\
        with the atoms of POSCAR2, based on the minimum rms.  When a   \n\
        POSCAR2 atom is matched it not considered for later matches. \n\
        The total rms based on these best matches is found by averaging   \n\
        all the individual atom RMS's.  The total RMS and the   \n\
        rsf for the best matched atoms are output. \n\
        rmax: The radius out to which the rdf is calculated. \n\
        nbins:  The number of bins for the rdf. \n\
        sigma:  The sigma of the gaussian used to smear the density. \n\
        nshmax:  The farthest possible shell used for computing RMS   \n\
                 with the rsf (if <nshmax shells are found then fewer \n\
                 will be used). \n\
        I think this works but large changes in shape give rsf that \n\
        are too different to compare exactly and the RMS!=0.  However, \n\
        looking at the output can make it clear how the shells are \n\
        related.  At this point the 2 structure must have the same \n\
        number of atoms of each type.  If you want to compare 2 POSCARs \n\
        where one is a multiple of the other in terms of atoms of   \n\
        each type you can create supercell (see --supercell) to make this \n\
        function usable. \n\

  aflow --rebuild_database \n\
        Fetches new entries and rebuilds the AFLOW database file. \n\

  aflow --revsg [#] [n] [l] [m] \n\
        Constructs a POSCAR of a specified space group and with specified wyckoff positions \n\
        #  is the space group number \n\
        n  multiplicity of wyckoff site (e.g., do position 4 g 1 twice) \n\
        l  specifies multiplicity group (e.g., positions with multiplicity 2) \n\
        m  position within multiplicity group (e.g., 2 would indicate the second position \n\
           with multiplicity defined by l). (R. Taylor). \n\

  aflow --rm_atom iatom < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out a POSCAR where iatom has been removed. \n\
        iatom must be between 0 to N-1. \n\
  aflow --rm_copies < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out a POSCAR where only the first appearance of \n\
        each cartesian position of the same type atom has been kept. \n\
        Useful if you have multiple copies of atoms at the same \n\
        positions for some reason. Note. This routine does not compare \n\
        equivalent lattice positions so you are not sure that equivalent \n\
        atoms are not in the same place. \n\
  aflow --rsm < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out a Rasmol (rsm) format file based on \n\
        the POSCAr input file. This output can be saved as .rsm file \n\
	  and is designed to be visualized in simpler version of Rasmol \n\
	  which is called RasTop program. It might work in Rasmol program \n\
	  directly. The format includes the plotting of the unit cell wireframe \n\
	  and spacefill 150 for the atomic radius. (WS Sept07) \n\
  aflow --rsm --z z_type1 z_type2 ... z_typeNtypes < POSCAR \n\
        Similar to aflow -rsm, with additional option of atom labeling \n\
	  based on the atomic number (z) of each type. If --z option is not \n\
	  used, the default is --z 1 2 3 ... Ntypes. (WS Sept07) \n\

  aflow --sd AA1 AA2 ... < POSCAR     \n\
        Outputs to standard out a POSCAR with selective dynamics \n\
        formatting.  AAi gives the selective dynamics setting for \n\
        atoms of type i and has the form AAi=TTT,TTF,etc..  If there \n\
        are fewer AAi than atom types then the remaining types are \n\
        defaulted to TTT. A warning will be printed and the default \n\
        value of TTT will be used if the AAi strings are shorters \n\
        than three characters. (SC0907) \n\
  aflow --setcm cm1 cm2 cm3 < POSCAR \n\
        Sets to center of mass to (cm1,cm2,cm3) by shifting all the \n\
        atom positions.  Use --mom to check the shift was correct. \n\
  aflow --setorigin r1 r2 r3 | atom# < POSCAR \n\
        With r1 r2 r3, it ets the origin to r1,r2,r3 by shifting all the \n\
        atom positions. Coordinates (r1,r2,r3) are considered fractional \n\
        is the POSCAR is in fractional, and cartesian otherwise. \n\
        With atom#, it sets the origin to the position of atom#  \n\
        (atom# goes from 0 to size-1). \n\
 \n\
  aflow --sewald eta < POSCAR \n\
        Finds the screened electrostatic energy of the POSCAR file using a \n\
        real space sum.  eta is now the screening length (ie, all   \n\
        coulomb interactions are multiplied by exp(-eta*R). \n\

        Outputs the following space group information: space group number, space group labels  \n\
        (Hermann Mauguin, Hall, Schoenflies), Laue class, crystal class, ITC setting, ITC origin shift,  \n\
        general Wyckoff position, and the WYCCAR (similar to --edata). \n\
        This routine consists of symmetry consistency checks. If symmetry rules are broken, \n\
        the code automatically changes tolerance and recalculates from the beginning. \n\
        Tolerance: \n\
           The tolerance is given in Angstroms.  There are two preset tolerances: \n\
             tight: minimum_interatomic_distance/100.0 \n\
             loose: minimum_interatomic_distance/10.0 \n\
           The default tolerance is the \"tight\" tolerance value. \n\
           A value can also be specified. (Note, it must not be below the minimum \n\
           interatomic distance, otherwise an error will be thrown.) \n\
        Magnetic analysis: \n\
          The magnetic tag specifies the magnetic moment on each of the atoms.  The \n\
          two input formats are a comma separated string of the magnetic moments - \n\
          in the same order as the input file, the location of the INCAR, or the location \n\
          of the OUTCAR, which is then read and the magnetic moment for each atom is found \n\
          (must be a static calculation, otherwise this information isn't specified). \n\
          Works for both collinear and non-collinear systems (AFLOW autodetects \n\
          collinear/non-collinear based on the input). \n\
        Space group setting: \n\
          The space group setting can be specified with the optional flag [--setting=1| =2] (the default is setting 1). \n\
          For rhombohedral systems, setting 1=rhl and 2=hex. \n\
          For monoclinic systems, setting 1=unique axis-b and 2=unique axis-c. \n\
        Options: \n\

 \n\
  aflow --shell=ns,r1,r2,name,dens < POSCAR \n\
        Based on the structure in POSCAR, this outputs to standard \n\
        out all points with ns neighbors in a shell define by inner \n\
        radius r1 and outer radius r2 (r1<r2).  The shell is \n\
        restricted to only consider atoms of type name (name=NONE (\"\")) \n\
        is unrestricted).  The dens is the linear density of \n\
        candidate points.  So for example, to search for all sites with \n\
        4 oxygen around them between 1.8 and 2.2 Angstron you could type \n\
          aflow --shell=4,1.8,2.2,O,20 \n\
        This would construct a 20x20x20 grid of puts in the cell and \n\
        print out all points that met the shell criteria.  The output \n\
        gives all the points and their shels meeting the shell criteria. \n\
        However, since many points are in the same shell it is \n\
        convenient to find unique shell environments.  Therefore, aflow \n\
        reduces the complete list to keep only one representative point \n\
        from each unique shell. The shells are distinguished by their \n\
        centers of mass.  The unique points and their shells are output \n\
        as all unique points meeting the shell criteria.  The \n\
        representative point for each shell is the shell center of mass. \n\
        This routine is great for finding open tetrahedral and octahedral \n\
        sites where one might put an intercalant.  This routine can \n\
        take a while to run (usually a 20x20x20 mesh is enough, and might \n\
        take a couple of minutes for a big cell - start small!). \n\
  aflow --shift=Sx,Sy,Sz[,cCdD] < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out a POSCAR with all positions shifted by   \n\
        S=(Sx,Sy,Sz).  The shifted is added to the positions.  The shift \n\
        is assumed to be given in Cartesian coordinates unless you specify \n\
        c or C for Cartesian or d or D for direct at the end. \n\

        Calculates the site point group symmetry for every atom in the \n\
        unit cell and writes it in the aflow.agroup.out file. \n\
        This routine consists of symmetry consistency checks. If symmetry rules are broken, \n\

             loose: minimum_interatomic_distance/10.0 \n\
           The default tolerance is the \"tight\" tolerance value. \n\

        Be careful because the size of the space group increases \n\
        as the radius^3 times the size of the factor roup. \n\
        The point and factopr groups are required for the space group, \n\

        Changes suffix of all VASPFILEs from VASPFILE*\"from\" to VASPFILE*\"to\". \n\
        If a directory is specified (e.g. aflow --suffix=abc,n2s)  \n\
        then it change abc/VASPFILE*\"from\" to abc/VASPFILE*\"to\" \n\
        Example: aflow --suffix=n2s   (or --suffix=none2static) \n\
        Change VASPFILE* to VASPFILE*.static \n\
        Example: aflow --suffix=s2n     (or --suffix=static2none) \n\
        Change VASPFILE*.static to VASPFILE* \n\

  aflow --sumpdos pdos.in PROOUT \n\
        Works for vasp.46x \n\
        This allows you to sum up projected DOS together for convenient \n\
        plotting.  It only works when you have run with the following   \n\
        INCAR file settings.  LORBIT=1 or 2 and set RWIGS, or   \n\
        LORBIT = 11 or 12 and no RWIGS (only works when using PAW PP). \n\
        If you are running parallel you must set NPAR=1.  The \n\
        input file is similar to --pdos above but somewhat simpler \n\
        so I give a full example here. \n\
         \n\
           # Input for aflow --sumpdos. \n\
           \n\
           # These values you supply once. \n\
           SPIN = 1 # 1 = non-spin polarized, 2 = spin polarized \n\
                    # Default 1 \n\
           EFERMI = -999 # This will be subracted from the energies. \n\
                            # Set to 0 to subtract nothing, -999 to use \n\
                         # the E_Fermi in the DOSCAR.  Default -999. \n\
           NLM = 9 # number of orbitals, 9 (spd:1+3+5) or 16 (spdf:1+3+5+7) \n\
                   # Default 9 \n\
           PRINT_PARAMS = 0 # 0=prints only data (easy to plot). \n\
                            # 1=prints all the input parameters. \n\
                            # default: 0 \n\
         \n\
           # You can have as many cases as you want. \n\
           # They are all added together. \n\
           \n\
           # case 1: t2g on atom 1 \n\
           ATOMS = 1 # default: no atoms \n\
           LMVALUES = 5 6 8 # default: no lm \n\
           # case 2: eg on atoms 2 and 3 \n\
           ATOMS = 2 3 # default: no atoms \n\
           LMVALUES = 7 9 # default: no lm \n\
         \n\
        All # denote comment lines and can be put anywhere.   \n\
        Each case is started when the token ATOMS is used.   \n\
        Following an ATOMS token, all LMVALUES tokens   \n\
        will apply to the atoms denoted in the preceeding   \n\
        ATOMS token until the next ATOM token. You can have any number   \n\
        of cases, and the results for all cases are added together.   \n\
        WARNING: make sure to use SPIN to set if it is a spin poloarized \n\
        calculation, make sure to use EFERMI to your desired reference, \n\
        and make sure to set NLM to 9 (spd) or 16 (spdf). \n\

  aflow --supercell=a11,a22,a33 < POSCAR \n\
  aflow --supercell=file < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out a supercell of the input POSCAR file. \n\
        This lattice vectors of the supercell are given by multiplying \n\
        the original cell parameters by the 3x3 matrix a_ij coefficients. \n\
        The supercell need not be integral combinations of the original \n\
        lattice vectors, although using fraction may cause you to end up \n\
        with a lattice inequivalent to your original. This can be used \n\
        to build big supercells, swap lattice vectors, etc. \n\
        The nine numbers must be separated spaces, and they form the \n\
        nine elements a11,a12,a13,a21,a22,a23,a31,a32,a33 of the 3x3 \n\
        supercell matrix, respectively. If you specify only 3 numbers, \n\
        the other six are taken zero. If you use the \"file\" syntax, \n\
        nine numbers are read from file. They can be on one or \n\
        mulitple lines. New algorithm by SC (aug07). \n\

        The structures are supercells formed using the supercell matrix \n\
        a11,a12,a13,a21,a22,a23,a31,a32,a33. If only 3 values are specified \n\
        the other are taken to be zero. If you use the \"file\" syntax, \n\
        nine numbers are read from file. They can be on one or mulitple \n\

  aflow --uffenergy | --ue <  POSCAR \n\
        Output the energy of the structure using the simplified Universal Force Filed (UFF) method [JACS, 114, 10024 (1992)]. \n\
 \n\
  aflow --update_database \n\
        Fetches new entries and rebuilds the AFLOW database file if new entries are available. \n\
 \n\
  aflow --vasp                                                                      \n\
        Transforms the GEOMETRICAL (or whicever is the input file format) to a         \n\
        VASP format.                                           \n\
 \n\

        Outputs POSCAR file giving having volume equal to v. \n\
  aflow --volume*= x < POSCAR \n\
  aflow --volume+= x < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs POSCAR with volume changes as *=, += actor (like in c,c++). \n\
 \n\
  aflow --wyccar[=tolerance | =tight | =loose] [--no_scan] [--setting=1| =2] [--mag|--magnetic|--magmom=[m1,m2,...|INCAR|OUTCAR]] < POSCAR \n\
        Prints the wyccar file (the poscar file with wyckoff positions) for the input POSCAR \n\
        The wyccar format presents the lattice in standard conventional form and the wyckoff  \n\
        positions with their associated labels and site symmetry. If variability in the  \n\
        Wyckoff positions exists, the algorithm finds the Wykoff positions with the \"smallest\"  \n\
        lettering scheme (\"a\" being the smallest). (R. Taylor/ D. Hicks) \n\
        Tolerance: \n\
           The tolerance is given in Angstroms.  There are two preset tolerances: \n\
             tight: minimum_interatomic_distance/100.0 \n\
             loose: minimum_interatomic_distance/10.0 \n\
           The default tolerance is the \"tight\" tolerance value. \n\
           A value can also be specified. (Note, it must not be below the minimum \n\
           interatomic distance, otherwise an error will be thrown.) \n\
        Space group setting: \n\
          The space group setting can be specified with the optional flag [--setting=1| =2] (the default is setting 1). \n\
          For rhombohedral systems, setting 1=rhl and 2=hex. \n\
          For monoclinic systems, setting 1=unique axis-b and 2=unique axis-c. \n\
        Magnetic analysis: \n\
          The magnetic tag specifies the magnetic moment on each of the atoms.  The \n\
          two input formats are a comma separated string of the magnetic moments - \n\
          in the same order as the input file, the location of the INCAR, or the location \n\
          of the OUTCAR, which is then read and the magnetic moment for each atom is found \n\
          (must be a static calculation, otherwise this information isn't specified). \n\
          Works for both collinear and non-collinear systems (AFLOW autodetects \n\
          collinear/non-collinear based on the input). \n\
        Options: \n\
          [--no_scan] : Will not perform tolerance scan. \n\
          [--mag|--magnetic|--magmom=[m1,m2,...|INCAR|OUTCAR]]: Perform symmetry analysis of spin system, where spin degree of freedom breaks symmetry \n\
        Check aflow --readme=symmetry \n\
 \n\
  aflow --xray=lambda < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out the powder xray scattering pattern for \n\
        the structure specified in the POSCAR input file.  The \n\
        wavelength of the scattering radiation is taken to be l. \n\
        The xray calculation is almost nothing more that the structure \n\
        factor, altough it includes approximate treatments of the \n\
        Debye-Waller terms and the Lorentz-polarization.  In the xray \n\
        calculations there are a number of terms that require a lot of \n\
        information to really do right so I approximate them.  First, \n\
        scattering factors default to the atomic number.  In some cases \n\
        I coded more accurate values taken from tables for lambda=1.5418. \n\
        No lambda dependence of the scattering factors is presently \n\
        included.  For the list of all coded atomic scattering factors \n\
        see the constructor for the structure class in structure.cc. \n\
        I include the Lorentz-polarization and an approximate \n\
        Debye-Waller factor (DWF).  The DWF is found assuming T=300, \n\
        T_Debye=300, and within the high-temperature Debye aproximation. \n\
        The atomic mass defaults to twice the atomic number but I \n\
        have input a few more accurate values in the code.  For the \n\
        list of all coded atomic masses see the constructor for the \n\
        structure class in structure.cc.  This simulation should \n\
        give very accurate peak locations and qualitative relative \n\
        integrated intensities (peak heights).   I am still not \n\
        happy with why the peak intensitities do not reproduce other \n\
        codes better.  The output contains formats with and without \n\
        peaks at the same 2theta grouped together.  It also contains \n\
        data ready for plotting.  Each type of data has a keyword on \n\
        every line so you can grep it out easily. \n\
  aflow --xray_peaks=lambda [--threshold=threshold] < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs the peaks in amplitude from the --xray analysis. \n\
        The order is sorted by amplitude. \n\
        The format is: \n\
 \n\
        X-Ray Peaks: \n\
        Two-Theta=34.008,40.488,77.689,53.878 \n\
        Amplitude=100,50.638,24.551,17.542 \n\
 \n\
  aflow --xrd_dist=h,k,l < POSCAR	 \n\
  	  Compute Miller plane distance (distance between planes of atoms). The triplet h,k,l \n\
        defines the plane spanned by the three points a/h,b/k,c/l, where a b c \n\
        are the CONVENTIONAL lattice vectors. You may enter h,k,l as integers \n\
        (e.g., 1 2 3), decimal numbers (e.g., 0.56 .4 .5), or fractions (e.g., 1/2 3/4 4/5) \n\
        or any combination of the three. The POSCAR must be in conventional form to get \n\
        meaningful results. You may first use the aflow command \"aflow --sc < POSCAR\" to get \n\
        standard conventional. For example, \n\
        cat POSCAR | aflow --sc | aflow --xrd_dist=1,0,0   	 \n\
  aflow --xyz[=n1[,n2[,n3]]] < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out an xyz file based on the POSCAR input \n\
        file.  This can be used as input for rasmol, xmol, etc.. \n\
        If you want atom names you must put them after each atom \n\
        position in the POSCAR file (see -names).  If any names are \n\
        missing they are defaulted to H. \n\
  aflow --xyzwignerseitz [--xyzws] < POSCAR \n\
        Performs \"aflow --xyz=1,1,1\" but moves the images \n\
        of the atoms in the Wigner-Seitz cell. This parameter \n\
        is usefull to fight against VASP trend of moving atoms \n\
        in different (but traslationally equivalent) positions \n\
        of the unit cell. (SC 10Jan04). \n\
 \n\
  aflow --zval[=directory] \n\
        Outputs from the available POTCAR/OUTCAR the sum of ZVAL. \n\
  aflow --zval_atom[=directory] \n\
        Outputs from the available POTCAR/OUTCAR and POSCAR/CONTCAR the ZVAL of the cell per atom. \n\

  aflow --justafter=string < something \n\
        Prints all the strings (defined by EOL) present in the \n\

        file (also stdout) \"something\" between the first occurence \n\
        of \"string_start\" to the first occurence of \"string_stop\". \n\

    	\"START.string_start\" \n\
	\"STOP.string_start\" \n\
   \n\
  aflow --qsub=N,file \n\
        perform N times the command \"qsub file\" (useful for rapid aflow submissions) \n\
  aflow --qdel=aaa,nnn:mmm,aaa,bbb,ccc \n\
        qdels all the jobs specified between \",\" and the \n\
        list of jobs between \":\" in increments of 1. \n\
        For instance  aflow --qdel 10:20,99,102 \n\
        qdels 10,11,12...20,99,102 \n\
 \n\
  aflow --bsub=N,file \n\
        perform N times the command \"bsub < file\" (useful for rapid aflow submissions) \n\
  aflow --bkill=aaa,nnn:mmm,aaa,bbb,ccc \n\
        bkills all the jobs specified between \",\" and the \n\
        list of jobs between \":\" in increments of 1. \n\
        For instance  aflow --bkill 10:20,99,102 \n\
        bkills 10,11,12...20,99,102 \n\
 \n\
  aflow --sbatch=N,file \n\
        perform N times the command \"sbatch file\" (useful for rapid aflow submissions) \n\
  aflow --scancel=aaa,nnn:mmm,aaa,bbb,ccc \n\
        scancels all the jobs specified between \",\" and the \n\
        list of jobs between \":\" in increments of 1. \n\
        For instance  aflow --scancel 10:20,99,102 \n\
        scancels 10,11,12...20,99,102 \n\
 \n\
  aflow --kill=aaa,nnn:mmm,aaa,bbb,ccc \n\
        kills all the jobs specified between \",\" and the \n\
        list of jobs between \":\" in increments of 1. \n\
        For instance  aflow --kill 10:20,99,102 \n\
        kills -9 10,11,12...20,99,102 \n\
 \n\
  aflow --multi=sh    Very useful option for scripting. \n\
         if you have a \"file\" containing a gazillion of instructions, \n\
         one per line, such as \n\
         command_perform ./directory1 \n\
         command_perform ./directory2 \n\
         ...... \n\
         command_perform ./directory.. \n\
         then the instruction \n\
  aflow --multi=sh --np=XX --FILE file \n\
         will pipe the instruction in a push-pop list and feed XX cpus in a \n\
         multithreaded environment. You can susbtitute \"--np=XX\" with \"--npmax\" \n\
         (or omit it at all) and use the max number of available cores in the \n\
         machine. Instead of --FILE you can use \" --F | -F | --f | -f\". \n\
         If you omit the --FILE option, then the last argument will \n\
         be taken as the name of the file. \n\
         Note that due to the variable nature of the time requested for each line, \n\
         you might loose causality in the whole process (most of the times \n\
         you do not need it, though). \n\
         These are examples of proper commands: \n\
           aflow --multi=sh --np=12 --FILE file   (run file in 12 cores) \n\
           aflow --multi=sh --np=12 file          (run file in 12 cores) \n\
           aflow --multi=sh file                  (run file in all your cores) \n\
 \n\
  aflow --multi=zip [--prefix=PREFIX] [--size=SSSS] [--add] --F file | -D directory1 directory2 .... \n\
         If you have a huge amount of directories to zip then you can clusterize them, so that \n\
         each subzip contains no more than SSSS entries. \n\
         The \"prefix=\" is optional, the default is \"m\" \n\
         The \"size=\" is optional, the default is 100. \n\
         If you add  --add then, if zips are present, they will be added with the new files. \n\
         This is a very useful option because many file systems do not allow big files. \n\
         I usually use: \n\
          aflow --multi=zip --prefix=magnetic --size=500 `find . -name EIGENVAL.bands.bz2` \n\
         To make life easier, this option clears up the words \n\
         \"LOCK,aflow.in,OUTCAR.relax2.bz2,EIGENVAL.bands.bz2\" from the directory names. \n\
 \n\
  aflow --multi=bzip2 --np=XX --FILE file file2 file3.... \n\
         if you have a huge amount of files to bzip2 then you can multithread the bzip2 so there are XX (np) cores doing it concurrently. \n\
         If --np=is not specified then the code will take 1 core. \n\
         The filenames with \".bz2\" extension are neglected. \n\
 \n\
  aflow --multi=bunzip2 --np=XX --FILE file.bz2 file2.bz2 file3.bz2.... \n\
         Same as --multi=bzip2 but for un-bzipping. \n\
         The filenames without \".bz2\" extension are neglected. \n\
   \n\
  aflow --multi=gzip --np=XX --FILE file file2 file3.... \n\
         if you have a huge amount of files to gzip then you can multithread the gzip so there are XX (np) cores doing it concurrently. \n\
         If --np=is not specified then the code will take 1 core. \n\
         The filenames with \".gz\" extension are neglected. \n\
  \n\
  aflow --multi=gunzip --np=XX --FILE file.gz file2.gz file3.gz.... \n\
         Same as --multi=gzip but for un-gzipping. \n\
         The filenames without \".gz\" extension are neglected. \n\
 \n\
  aflow --multi=xz|--multi=xzip --np=XX --FILE file file2 file3.... \n\
         if you have a huge amount of files to xzip then you can multithread the xzip so there are XX (np) cores doing it concurrently. \n\
         If --np=is not specified then the code will take 1 core. \n\
         The filenames with \".xz\" extension are neglected. \n\
  \n\
  aflow --multi=xunzip --np=XX --FILE file.xz file2.xz file3.xz.... \n\
         Same as --multi=xz|--multi=xzip but for un-xzipping. \n\
         The filenames without \".xz\" extension are neglected. \n\
 \n\
 aflow --multi=bz2xz --np=XX --FILE file.bz2 file2.bz2 file3.bz2.... \n\
         bzip2-decompress and xz-compress. \n\
         The filenames without \".bz2\" extension are neglected. \n\
 \n\
 aflow --multi=gz2xz --np=XX --FILE file.gz file2.gz file3.gz.... \n\
         gzip-decompress and xz-compress. \n\
         The filenames without \".gz\" extension are neglected. \n\
 \n\
 aflow --getTEMP [--runstat | --runbar | --refresh=X | --warning_beep=T | --warning_halt=T | --mem=XX ] \n\
         If available, the command outputs the hostname and temperatures of the machine. Useful to find hardware issues: \n\
         with --runstat the command continuously prints the temperature, refreshing every XX refresh seconds; \n\
         with --runbar the command prints a bar with the temperature, refreshing every XX refresh seconds; \n\
         with --refresh=X you can specify the refresh time (DEFAULT below) \n\
         with --warning_beep=T, if the max temp goes beyond T(C, DEFAULT below), the command beeps the computer speaker; \n\
         with --warning_halt=T, it the max temp goes beyond T(C, DEFAULT below), the command halts the computer (aflow must be run as root). \n\
         with --max==X | --maxmem=XX, it kills vasp/mpivasp using more than XX% of memory. \n\
         DEFAULT VALUES in .aflow.rc \n\
 \n\
  aflow --monitor [--mem=XX] \n\
         This is a wrap up set of commands to be sent in the background so that the node is monitored for health/ \n\
         It kills vasp/mpivasp using more than XX% of memory. \n\
         The default for XX is 95%/NCPUs, so even in the worst scenario there shoud be enough RAM to resuscitate \n\
         a soon-to-be-frozen machine/node. \n\

2) Once the appropriate aflow.in file is setup, you run aflow. \n\
This will analyze your aflow.in and add frozsl output within lines \n\
[AFLOW_FROZSL]CALC.START \n\
... \n\
[AFLOW_FROZSL]CALC.STOP \n\
VASP poscars within \n\
[VASP_POSCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT]START.mode*_disp* \n\
.... \n\
[VASP_POSCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT]STOP.mode*_disp* \n\
and produce the various subdirectories with the ARUN.mode*_disp*/aflow.in. \n\
You can look all the process inside aflow.in below the line \n\
[AFLOW_FROZSL]CALC \n\
 \n\
If something goes wrong, or if you you change your mind about phonons paths and/or parameters, \n\
you have to delete ALL the text below [AFLOW_FROZSL]CALC (but keep this line !!), \n\
fix your aflow.in and repeat step 2. \n\
 \n\
3) let your aflow daemon run your new aflow.ins representing displacements associated to the \n\
irreducible representations one by one in sub-directories labeled as ARUN.mode*_disp*. \n\
Once in a while you should check if there is an OUTCAR that has not been touched for a while. This indicates incomplete termination of VASP. \n\
If the process gets stuck somewhere, delete the directory of the OUTCAR which is not been finished, \n\
then delete the LOCK file of aflow, and restart aflow. The completed directories will not be modified. \n\
 \n\
4) when all the directories have finished, run \n\
aflow --frozsl_output \n\
This command will analyze your aflow.in, scan through all the subdirectories, warn you if there are missing calculations. \n\
The eigen-energies and eigen-modes of the phonons will be printed on the screen and saved in the eigen.out file. \n\
 \n\
Good luck. \n\

This file describes how to make FINDSYM/FROZSL work within gfortran compiler. \n\
 \n\
----------------------------------------FINDSYM---------------------------------------- \n\
Change all the function \"dcosd\" and \"dsind\" to \"dcos\" and \"dsin\", respectively, in the files \n\
lattparam_to_cart.f, and wavelength_to_rgb.f, and multiply it with \"2.0*pi/360.0D0\". \n\
Examples: \n\
basis(1,2)=abc(2)*cos(abc(6)) \n\
basis(2,2)=abc(2)*sin(abc(6)) \n\
 \n\
is changed to: \n\
basis(1,2)=abc(2)*dcos(abc(6)*2.0*pi/360.0D0) \n\
basis(2,2)=abc(2)*dsin(abc(6)*2.0*pi/360.0D0) \n\
----------------------------------------FINDSYM---------------------------------------- \n\
 \n\
----------------------------------------FORZSL---------------------------------------- \n\
1. Change all the function \"dacosd\" as \"dacos\", and multiply it with \"360.0D0/2.0/pi\" in the file \"frozsl_init.f\". \n\
Make sure to include the constant value of pi by adding one statement \"include 'dpi_real.f'\" after \n\
the \"implicit none \" line in the beginning of the file. \n\
 \n\
Examples: \n\
alpha2=dacosd(dot(2,3)/b2/c2) \n\
beta2=dacosd(dot(3,1)/c2/a2) \n\
gamma2=dacosd(dot(1,2)/a2/b2) \n\
 \n\
are changed to: \n\
alpha2=dacos(dot(2,3)/b2/c2)*360.0D0/2.0/pi \n\
beta2=dacos(dot(3,1)/c2/a2)*360.0D0/2.0/pi \n\
gamma2=dacos(dot(1,2)/a2/b2)*360.0D0/2.0/pi \n\
 \n\
2. Comment the assignment statement \"dwyxyz2=0\" at 1133 line of the \"frozsl_init.f\" file! \n\
This is not necessary and not supported in gfortran! \n\
 \n\
3. Change the statement \"CALL CARPOV(U,W,Y,KKX,NV,N,maxeig)\" to \"CALL CARPOV(U,W,Y,dble(KKX),NV,N,maxeig)\" at line 203 of the file \"hfroz.f\". \n\
 \n\
Finally, note that you need to add -llapack package in the linux OS. \n\

 \n\
2) Once the appropriate aflow.in file is finished, you have to prepare the input with \n\
aflow --pocc_input \n\
This command will analyze your partially occupied structure from aflow.in file, which is between the lines: \n\
[POCC_MODE_EXPLICIT]START.POCC_STRUCTURE \n\
... \n\
[POCC_MODE_EXPLICIT]STOP.POCC_STRUCTURE \n\
In addition, the command will also generate a series of nonequivalent structures according to your partially occupied structure. \n\
The log will be save in \"LOG.POCC\" file. \n\
 \n\
3) let your aflow daemon run your new aflow.in. The code will do the calculations for all the structures. \n\
Once in a while you should check if there is an OUTCAR that has not been touched for a while. This indicates incomplete termination of VASP. \n\
If the process gets stuck somewhere, delete the directory of the OUTCAR which is not been finished, \n\
then delete the LOCK file of aflow, and restart aflow. The completed directories will not be modified. \n\
The running step does not require an internet connection, so it is safe to run the displacements in a supercomputer with many nodes. \n\
 \n\
A simple trick. If you want to speed up the calculation, after aflow starts and creates its LOCK, you can rename the LOCK as LOCK1. \n\
This  will not interfere with the running process since the code keeps a pointer to the physical file. \n\
 \n\
4) when all the directories have finished, run \n\
4.1) aflow --pocc_dos=DIRECTORY,TEMPERATURE \n\
Firstly, this command will analyze your aflow.in, scan through all the subdirectories, warn you if there are missing calculations. \n\
If this is a complete calculation, then this command will generate the density of states (DOS) plot for the partially occupied structure at  \n\
a specified temperature. \n\
 \n\
4.2) aflow --pocc_bandgap=DIRECTORY,TEMPERATURE \n\
This command will produce the band gap of the partially occupied structure at the specified temperature. The band gap estimation comes from the  \n\
density of states (DOS). \n\
 \n\
4.3) aflow --pocc_mag=DIRECTORY,TEMPERATURE \n\
This command will produce the magnetic moment of the partially occupied structure at the specified temperature. \n\
 \n\
Good luck. \n\

Phonon calculations with deformations written by Michal Jahnatek, Pinku Nath, Jose J. Plata,  \n\
Corey Oses, Marco Esters, and Stefano Curtarolo. \n\
 \n\
The current version of the Automatic Phonon Library (APL) can calculate the phonon dispersion \n\
curves, phonon density of states, and thermal properties. All are calculated in the harmonic \n\
approximation. Two methods of calculation can be selected: the direct (supercell) method (DM) and \n\
the linear response method (LR). The resulting output files can be transformed into agr, ps, eps, \n\

The Automatic Anharmonic Phonon Library (AAPL) is an expansion of APL and can calculate the lattice \n\
thermal conductivity of a material via the Boltzmann Transport Equation using anharmonic \n\
interatomic force constants.  \n\
 \n\
The default values of APL and AAPL can be changed by editing the appropriate values in aflow.rc. \n\

1. Running APL \n\
 \n\
To perform a phonon calculation, the following line has to be present in the aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_APL]CALC \n\
 \n\
If it does not exist, the job is not interpreted as a phonon calculation and no other phonon \n\
settings are read. \n\
 \n\
The calculation of phonon-related properties requires very accurate forces. To achieve this, the \n\
input structure needs to be relaxed with very tight convergence criteria for the total energy and \n\
forces. This can be achieved in one of two ways: \n\
 \n\
  * (VASP only) By setting the following flags: \n\
 \n\
      [AFLOW_APL]RELAX=ON \n\
      [AFLOW_APL]PREC=PHONONS \n\
 \n\
    These are also the default values. Setting RELAX=ON makes APL run two relaxation calculations \n\
    with the precision given in PREC. This method is especially useful when a relaxed structure \n\
    already exists. The input and output files are saved in XXXCAR.relax_phononsN with N = 1,2. \n\
    For more information on the PREC option, see Section 2.1.1. \n\
 \n\
  * By relaxing the structure in a normal AFLOW relaxation calculation using the flag: \n\
 \n\
      [VASP_FORCE_OPTION]PREC=PHONONS \n\
 \n\
    APL can be run afterwards with the resulting structure. [AFLOW_APL]RELAX should be set to OFF. \n\
 \n\
 \n\
2. Choosing a Phonon Calculation Method \n\
 \n\
The user has the possibility to choose two methods of calculation using the keyword ENGINE: the \n\
direct method (DM), also known as supercell method, and the linear response method (LR). To  \n\
choose the DM, one has to write: \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_APL]ENGINE=DM \n\
 \n\
This is also a default setting. For the linear response method, it is: \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_APL]ENGINE=LR \n\
 \n\
Each method has its own parameters, but there are also some common ones that can be used to tune \n\
the whole calculation. \n\
 \n\
2.1. Common Parameters Used by Both Methods \n\
 \n\
2.1.1. The Precision Parameter \n\
 \n\
The precision for the phonon calculations can be set using the flag: \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_APL]PREC=PHONONS \n\
 \n\
This parameter is similar [VASP_FORCE_OPTION]PREC and guides the precision of the relaxation \n\
calculation when [AFLOW_APL]RELAX is set to ON as well as all APL and AAPL calculations. The \n\
default is PHONONS. The setting of [VASP_FORCE_OPTION]PREC has no influence on the APL and AAPL \n\
alculation. \n\
 \n\
APL also introduces the new option \"PHONONS\" for the PREC parameter, which can be used for both \n\
the [AFLOW_APL]PREC and the [VASP_FORCE_OPTION]PREC flag. It adds the following lines in the \n\
INCAR file: \n\
 \n\
PREC = ACCURATE \n\
LREAL = .FALSE. \n\
EDIFF = 1E-8 \n\
EDIFFG = -0.001 \n\
NELMIN = 4 \n\
NELM = 120 \n\
ADDGRID = .TRUE. \n\
ALGO = NORMAL \n\
 \n\
NOTE: PREC=PHONONS overrides the [VASP_FORCE_OPTION]ALGO flag. \n\
 \n\
2.1.2. Supercell Parameters \n\
 \n\
The most important setting is the supercell dimensions (a supercell is required by both methods). \n\
The supercell can be set by the following commands (in order of precedence): \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_APL]SUPERCELL=numberXnumberXnumber \n\
    [AFLOW_APL]MINATOMS_RESTRICTED=number \n\
    [AFLOW_APL]MINATOMS=number \n\
    [AFLOW_APL]MINSHELL=number \n\
 \n\
Examples: \n\
 \n\
    * Direct specification of the supercell dimensions, e.g.: \n\
             \n\
        [AFLOW_APL]SUPERCELL=4x4x4 \n\
 \n\
    * Require a minimum number of atoms, e.g.: \n\
 \n\
        [AFLOW_APL]MINATOMS=100 \n\
 \n\
      The code will homogeneously increase the volume of the supercell until it finds a \n\
      SUPERCELL(i,j,k) containing at least the number of atoms specified. \n\
 \n\
      If it is desired that the supercell is expanded equally in all directions, i.e. to use \n\
      SUPERCELL(i,i,i), use the flag MINATOMS_RESTRICTED as in: \n\
 \n\
        [AFLOW_APL]MINATOMS_RESTRICTED=100 \n\
 \n\
       MINATOMS_RESTRICTED takes precedence over MINATOMS. \n\
 \n\
     * Specifying the minimal number of nearest neighbor shells, e.g.: \n\
 \n\
        [AFLOW_APL]MINSHELL=6 \n\
 \n\
      The default settings is MINSHELL=6 and APL will construct the appropriate supercell. HOWEVER, \n\
      THIS IS NOT THE RECOMMENDED WAY BECAUSE THE INCLUSION OF 6 SHELLS IS SUFFICIENT ONLY FOR VERY \n\
      SIMPLE MATERIALS. There is unfortunately no rule on how to find the ideal number of shells \n\
      for the calculation. \n\
 \n\
If no option is specified, AFLOW will use the default value for MINATOMS. For best results, it is \n\
recommended to specify the supercell dimensions directly. We found that 4x4x4 is usually enough for \n\
all fcc systems; 3x3x2 for hcp; bcc cells are complicated, but generally, it should be more that \n\
3x3x3. Typically, the supercell with about 100 atoms should be fine for the majority of crystal \n\
systems. The MINATOMS option might be useful for large unit cells. \n\
 \n\
2.1.3. k-Point Parameters \n\
 \n\
The k-point mesh can be set separately for APL calculations. The settings are similar to the \n\
general AFLOW k-point parameters: \n\
 \n\
    * The number of k-points per reciprocal atoms can be set via: \n\
 \n\
        [AFLOW_APL]KPPRA=number \n\
 \n\
      By default, AFLOW takes the number of KPOINTS (KPPRA) from the \"[VASP_KPOINTS_FILE]KPPRA\" \n\
      entry. The \"[AFLOW_APL]KPPRA\" flag overrides this for APL calculations. See README_AFLOW.TXT \n\
      for more information on KPPRA. \n\
 \n\
    * The k-point scheme can be set using: \n\
 \n\
        [AFLOW_APL]KSCHEME=scheme \n\
 \n\
      By default, AFLOW takes the KPOINTS scheme from the \"[VASP_KPOINTS_FILE]KSCHEME\" entry. The \n\
      \"[AFLOW_APL]KSCHEME\" overrides this setting. See README_AFLOW.TXT for more information on \n\
      KSCHEME. \n\
 \n\
    * The k-point parity can be set using: \n\
 \n\
        [AFLOW_APL]KPOINTS=EVEN | ODD \n\
 \n\
      By default, AFLOW takes the KPOINTS parity from \"[VASP_FORCE_OPTION]KPOINTS\" entry, if \n\
      specified. \"[AFLOW_APL]KPOINTS\" overrides this setting. See README_AFLOW.TXT for more \n\
      information on KPOINTS. \n\
 \n\
These k-point settings will also be used for the structural relaxations (see Section 1). \n\
 \n\
2.1.4. Polar Corrections \n\
 \n\
If the studied system is polar, dipole-dipole interactions need to be taken into account. This \n\
can be specified by the keyword POLAR. This keyword can be set in the aflow.in file as follows: \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_APL]POLAR=ON \n\
 \n\
This instructs APL to calculate the Born effective charge tensor and the dielectric constant \n\
tensor using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). The default setting is POLAR=OFF, i.e. \n\
no polar calculations are performed. \n\
 \n\
DFPT calculations require VASP 5.2 or higher. APL will check if the appropriate binary file is \n\
present upon start-up, and will refuse to continue if the appropriate VASP version is not found. \n\
They also require large stack sizes, so it is critical that the stack size is set to unlimited. \n\
Otherwise, VASP will likely crash at some point during the calculation. To set the stack size to \n\
unlimited, the following line needs to be written either in the .bashrc file or the job script: \n\
 \n\
    ulimit -s unlimited \n\
 \n\
The dielectric constant tensor and the Born effective charge tensor is by default calculated using \n\
the tag LEPSILON in the VASP INCAR file, but can be calculated using LCALCEPS as well. To switch to \n\
LCALCEPS, the value DEFAULT_APL_USE_LEPSILON in the aflow.rc file needs to be set to false (0). \n\
 \n\
2.2. Direct Method Parameters \n\
 \n\
The direct method (DM) requires the calculation of the forces for each unique atom in the primitive \n\
cell along three independent directions. However, some of these directions are related by symmetry \n\
and it is thus unnecessary to perform DFT calculations for all three distortions. For example, if \n\
one distortion direction can by symmetry produce three linearly independent vectors, the atom only \n\
needs to be distorted in one direction. The remaining two can be recovered by the symmetry of the \n\
system as is the case for an fcc lattice. APL will try to determine these distortions to reduce \n\
the number of DFT calculations that need to be performed. \n\
 \n\
Generally, APL will distort an atom along the [100], [010], [001], [110], [101], [011], and the \n\
[111] direction. It will apply all site symmetry operations, and the direction that produces the \n\
highest number of new independent vectors will by used for the DFT calculations. \n\
 \n\
To filter out potential anharmonic effects from the forces, APL distorts the atom into the positive \n\
and negative direction of the chosen distortions. The final force acting on each is then calculated \n\
as 0.5 * (f(+) - f(-)). \n\
 \n\
There are multiple parameters that control how the distortions for the direct method are generated. \n\
 \n\
    * The distortion magnitude in Angstrom is set via the DMAG entry, e.g.: \n\
 \n\
        [AFLOW_APL]DMAG=0.015 \n\
 \n\
      The default is 0.015 Angstrom, which is generally accepted to be sufficient for all systems. \n\
 \n\
    * If the atoms shall only be distorted along the cell axes ([100], [010], [001]), the DXYZONLY \n\
      flag needs to be set to true, i.e.: \n\
 \n\
        [AFLOW_APL]DXYZONLY=ON \n\
 \n\
      The default is DXYZONLY=OFF, which will also search along the face and body diagonals. \n\
      DXYZONLY is particularly useful for cells where one primitive cell vector is much longer than \n\
      the others. \n\
 \n\
    * To prevent the reduction of distortions by factor groups (inequivalent atoms), the DINEQUIV_ONLY entry needs to be set to false: \n\
 \n\
        [AFLOW_APL]DINEQUIV_ONLY=OFF \n\
 \n\
      In this case, APL will generate VASP runs for distortions of ALL atoms. \n\
     \n\
    * To prevent the reduction of distortions by site symmetry, the DSYMMETRIZE entry needs to be set to false: \n\
 \n\
        [AFLOW_APL]DSYMMETRIZE=OFF \n\
 \n\
      In this case, APL will generate VASP runs for three distortion directions per site. \n\
 \n\
    * To prevent the automatic generation of negative distortions, the DPM entry needs to be unset: \n\
 \n\
        [AFLOW_APL]DPM=OFF \n\
 \n\
      In this case, APL will determine whether the negative distortions are required or if they \n\
      can be recovered by symmetry. If the DPM entry is not found, APL decides on a per-site basis \n\
      whether negative distortions are necessary. \n\
 \n\
If the primitive structure is not well relaxed or cannot be relaxed within a given precision, the \n\
unstrained state has some non-zero forces. In this case, it is possible to subtract these forces \n\
from all distorted states. This can be done using the keyword: \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_APL]ZEROSTATE=ON \n\
 \n\
If activated, APL will generate a calculation of the undistorted supercell and the obtained forces \n\
will be subtracted from all other strained calculations. The default is ZEROSTATE=OFF. \n\
WARNING: This method is not well tested yet and should be used with caution. \n\
 \n\
The ZEROSTATE calculation can also be used to accelerate the DFT calculations of the distorted \n\
cells by using its charge density. To do this, the following keyword needs to be activated: \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_APL]ZEROSTATE_CHGCAR=ON \n\
 \n\
The default is OFF. \n\
 \n\
2.3.  Linear Response Method Parameters \n\
 \n\
The use of the linear response method as implemented in VASP requires VASP version 5.2 or higher. \n\
APL will check if the appropriate binary file is present upon start-up, and will refuse to continue \n\
if the appropriate VASP version is not found. \n\
 \n\
LR calculations require large stack sizes, so it is critical that the stack size is set to \n\
unlimited. Otherwise, VASP will likely crash at some point during the calculation. To set the stack \n\
size to unlimited, the following line needs to be written either in the .bashrc or the job script: \n\
 \n\
    ulimit -s unlimited \n\
 \n\
In contrast to the DM method, APL is not responsible for finding the appropriate set of distortion \n\
vectors for LR calculations as it is all done by VASP. Hence, long run DFT calculations are to be \n\
expected. Please note, the VASP is using the mode XYZONLY so that more distortions are generated \n\
than in the DM method. \n\
 \n\
APL will use the file DYNMAT, which is generated by VASP, as the basis for post-processing. \n\
 \n\
 \n\
3. Calculating Phonon Properties \n\
 \n\
APL can calculate phonon dispersion curves, phonon density of states, and various thermodynamic \n\
properties. They are activated by the following keywords: \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_APL]DC=ON \n\
    [AFLOW_APL]DOS=ON \n\
    [AFLOW_APL]TP=ON \n\
 \n\
The default is 'ON' for all. To switch off these calculations, the parameter needs to be set to \n\
'OFF'. Each calculation mode has its own set of parameters, which are described in the following \n\
sections. \n\
 \n\
3.1. Phonon Dispersion Curves \n\
 \n\
The calculated dispersion curves are saved in the file aflow.apl.phonon_dispersion.out, where the \n\
1st column is the ID of points in the sub-path, the 2nd is the position in the whole path, and the \n\
remaining columns are the energies/frequencies of the phonon branches. \n\
 \n\
The phonon dispersion curve calculations have three adjustable parameters: the dispersion path, \n\
the point density, and the frequency unit. \n\
 \n\
    * There are two ways to set the path of the phonon dispersion curve: by using the default path \n\
      of the Bravais lattice of the cell as specified in [doi=10.1016/j.commatsci.2010.05.010], or \n\
      by specifying the path manually. The keyword to guide this choice is: \n\
 \n\
        [AFLOW_APL]DCPATH=LATTICE|MANUAL \n\
 \n\
      LATTICE (default) chooses the default path, points and labels of the lattice. A different \n\
      path can be chosen using the following format. \n\
 \n\
             [AFLOW_APL]DCUSERPATH=G-X|X-U|K-G|G-L \n\
 \n\
      The labels must correspond to the labels for the lattice as set by the AFLOW standard. \n\
       \n\
      MANUAL lets the user specify which path and points to use. Three parameters need \n\
      to be set to use MANUAL. \n\
 \n\
      1. The coordinates of each path end point can be set in fractional or Cartesian coordinates \n\
         using the DCINITCOORDSFRAC and DCINITCOORDSCART keywords, respectively: \n\
 \n\
             [AFLOW_APL]DCINITCOORDSFRAC=0,0,0;0.5,0.5,0.5;... \n\
             [AFLOW_APL]DCINITCOORDSCART=0,0,0;0.5,0.5,0.5;... \n\
 \n\
         Each coordinate triplet has to be separated by a semicolon. Fractional coordinates take \n\
         priority over Cartesian coordinates. \n\
 \n\
      2. The labels of each end point need to be defined using DCINITCOORDSLABELS as in: \n\
 \n\
             [AFLOW_APL]DCINITCOORDSLABELS=G,L,M,X... \n\
 \n\
         Where the first label corresponds to the first coordinate triplet in DCINITCOORDSFRAC or \n\
         DCINITCOORDSCART. The labels have to be separated by a comma, not a semicolon. \n\
 \n\
      3. Finally, the path can be specified with the aforementioned labels using DCUSERPATH. \n\
 \n\
    * The number of points for each sub-path is set with the DCPOINTS keyword, e.g.: \n\
 \n\
        [AFLOW_APL]DCPOINTS=100 \n\
 \n\
    * For the frequency, a variety of options are available. They can be set as: \n\
 \n\
        [AFLOW_APL]FREQFORMAT=format \n\
 \n\
      Where format needs to be replaced with the appropriate format specifier. These are HERTZ, \n\
      THZ, MEV, and RECIPROCAL_CM or CM-1. \n\
 \n\
      These frequencies do not include the factor 2 pi. To include it, OMEGA needs to be added \n\
      to the format specifier, e.g.: \n\
 \n\
        [AFLOW_APL]FREQFORMAT=THZ|OMEGA \n\
 \n\
      A colon (:), a semicolon(;), or a comma (,) may also be used as delimiters. \n\
 \n\
      At last, it can be specified whether imaginary frequencies should be set to 0.0 or set to a \n\
      negative value. If they are set to negative values, ALLOW_NEGATIVE needs to be added to the \n\
      format specifier, e.g.: \n\
 \n\
        [AFLOW_APL]FREQFORMAT=THZ|ALLOW_NEGATIVE \n\
 \n\
      If imaginary frequencies should be set to 0.0, ALLOW_NEGATIVE must not be included, e.g.: \n\
 \n\
        [AFLOW_APL]FREQFORMAT=THZ \n\
 \n\
      Sets all imaginary frequencies to 0.0 while all real frequencies are given in THz. \n\
      The ALLOW_NEGATIVE specifier may be combined with OMEGA, e.g. in: \n\
 \n\
        [AFLOW_APL]FREQFORMAT=THZ|OMEGA|ALLOW_NEGATIVE \n\
 \n\
      The default specifier is THZ|ALLOW_NEGATIVE. \n\
 \n\
3.2.  Phonon Density of States \n\
 \n\
The phonon density of states (pDOS) are saved into the file aflow.apl.phonon_dos.out. Besides the \n\
pDOS, this file also contains the frequencies in THz, the wavenumbers in inverse cm, and the \n\
energies in meV. \n\
 \n\
There are multiple parameters for the pDOS: the Brillouin zone integration method, the k-point \n\
mesh, the number of energy points, and the smearing width. \n\
 \n\
    * There are two implementations for the integration of the Brillouin zone: the Linear Tetrahedron \n\
      method (LT) and the Root Sampling method (RS). They can be set as: \n\
 \n\
        [AFLOW_APL]DOSMETHOD=LT(RS) \n\
 \n\
      Default is DOSMETHOD=LT. \n\
 \n\
    * The mesh of q-points used for numerical integration should be set as: \n\
 \n\
        [AFLOW_APL]DOSMESH=21x21x21 \n\
 \n\
      This is also the default setting. APL will automatically find the irreducible part of the \n\
      of BZ (the list of irreducible q-points with appropriate summation weights). Only for these \n\
      q-points is a dynamical matrix constructed and diagonalized. For the LT method, the list of \n\
      irreducible tetrahedrons with their weights is constructed and used in summation. \n\
 \n\
    * The number of points in the pDOS can be set via the keyword DOSPOINTS, e.g.: \n\
 \n\
        [AFLOW_APL]DOSPOINTS=2000 \n\
 \n\
      This is also the default setting. \n\
 \n\
    * The pDOS can be smeared using a Gaussian function. To specify the width of this function, the \n\
      DOSSMEAR tag can be set, e.g.: \n\
 \n\
        [AFLOW_APL]DOSSMEAR=0.05 \n\
 \n\
      This is especially important for the RS method. The default is 0.05 for the RS method and \n\
      0.0 for the LT method (i.e. no smearing). \n\
 \n\
Projected DOS can also be calculted using the keyword DOSPROJECTIONS: \n\
 \n\
        [AFLOW_APL]DOSPROJECTIONS_CART=1,0,0;0,1,0;0,0,1 \n\
                                 or \n\
        [AFLOW_APL]DOSPROJECTIONS_FRAC=-1,1,1;1,-1,1;1,1,-1 \n\
 \n\
Where DOSPROJECTIONS_CART and DOSPROJECTIONS_FRAC give the projection directions in Cartesian and \n\
fractional coordinates, respectively. It is not possible to choose both options. If neither option \n\
is populated, projected DOS will not be calculated. \n\
 \n\
Each projection vector triplet needs to be separated by a semicolon, and the coordinates inside the \n\
triplets must be separated by commas. The projection vectors have to be given in Cartesian \n\
coordinates. Per default, both are turned off. \n\
 \n\
Projected DOS are currently only available for the linear tetrahedron method. \n\
 \n\
3.3. Thermodynamic Properties \n\
 \n\
APL can calculate a variety of thermodynamic properties. These are the zero point vibrational \n\
energy (U0), the internal energy (U), the vibrational free energy (Fv), the vibrational \n\
entropy (Sv), and the isochoric specific heat (cv) for a given temperature range. The results are \n\
written into the file aflow.apl.thermodynamic_properties.out. \n\
 \n\
The temperature range can be set as: \n\
 \n\
        [AFLOW_APL]TPT=TSTART:TEND:TSTEP \n\
 \n\
Where TSTART and TEND are the initial and final temperature, respectively, and TSTEP is the \n\
temperature step size. The default setting is 0:2000:10, i.e. it calculates the properties from 0 K \n\
to 2000 K in 10 K steps. \n\
 \n\
4. Saving and Loading APL Results APL Calculations (Hibernation) \n\
 \n\
In order to avoid recalculating the force constant matrix with every run, APL has implemented a \n\
hibernation system which saves the forces, the force constants, the Born effective charge tensor, \n\
and the dielectric constant tensor into an output file (aflow.apl.harmonicIFCs.xml). \n\
 \n\
This behavior can be switched on(off) using the HIBERNATE keyword:  \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_APL]HIBERNATE=ON(OFF) \n\
 \n\
It is turned on by default. \n\
 \n\
 \n\
5. Inheritance from AFLOW \n\
 \n\
The generated ARUN.APL***/aflow.in input files inherit some options from the master aflow.in \n\
If present, the following options are passed to the local aflow.in: \n\
 \n\
    [VASP_FORCE_OPTION]AUTO_PSEUDOPOTENTIALS=... \n\
    [VASP_FORCE_OPTION]SPIN=... \n\

7. The Automatic Anharmonic Phonon Library  \n\
 \n\
7.1. Running AAPL Calculations \n\
 \n\
The Automatic Anharmonic Phonon Library (AAPL) is the anharmonic extension to APL and calculates \n\
anharmonic interatomic force constants (IFCs). These can then be used to calculate the lattice \n\
thermal conductivity by solving the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE). AAPL can use three-phonon \n\
processes to calculate thermal conductivities. \n\
 \n\
To use AAPL, the following needs to be added to the aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_AAPL]CALC \n\
 \n\
This overrides all other APL CALC options. An AAPL calculation requires three separate AFLOW runs: \n\
 \n\
    1. In the first run, the distortions for the anharmonic IFCs (and harmonic IFCs, if not \n\
       already present) are created. If the option REALX is set to ON, APL will relax the structure \n\
       before creating the distortions. \n\
 \n\
    2. The DFT calculations are performed. However, due to the large number of DFT calculations, it \n\
       is recommended to run each calculation in its own separate AFLOW run. \n\
 \n\
    3. Post-processing: the harmonic and anharmonic IFCs and the thermal conductivity tensor are \n\
       calculated. \n\
 \n\
AAPL shares the supercell parameters and the HIBERNATE keyword with APL. AAPL hibernate file store \n\
the clusters and the anharmonic IFCs. IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO USE THE HIBERNATE FUNCTION! The \n\
number of calculations for AAPL is very large, so processing the DFT calculations can take a long \n\
time whereas reading the hibernate files takes only a couple of seconds. Moreover, if LR is chosen \n\
for the APL calculations, the DMAG keyword still needs to be specified for AAPL. \n\
 \n\
7.2. Anharmonic Interatomic Force Constants \n\
 \n\
Anharmonic IFCs are calculated using the direct method. It is necessary to define a cut-off radius \n\
beyond which the interactions between atoms are considered negligible. Within this shell, clusters \n\
of atoms (three atoms for third order IFCs, four atoms for fourth order IFCs, etc.) are created and \n\
distorted. The number of clusters and distortions is then reduced by symmetry to save computational \n\
resources. The resulting distorted structures are then output into their own aflow.in files inside \n\
a subfolder. These folder all have the name: \n\
 \n\
    ARUN.AAPL_N_XX_Aat1Dd1-Aat2Dd2-... \n\
 \n\
Where the N in N is replaced with the phonon process order; at1, at2, etc. are the atomic indices \n\
of the distorted atoms; and d1, d2, etc. are the distortion indices corresponding to the atom. They \n\
range from 0 to 5 and correspond to Cartesian +x, +y, +z, -x, -y, -z. Note that when one distortion \n\
index appears twice on the same atom, the atom is not distorted twice into the same direction. \n\
 \n\
Once the DFT calculations are finished, the forces are read and the IFCs are determined using a \n\
self-consistent field.  \n\
 \n\
7.2.1. Cluster Parameters \n\
 \n\
The supercell and the distortion magnitude are defined the same way as in APL. See Section 2.1.1. \n\
for the supercell parameters and Section 2.2. for the distortion magnitude. \n\
 \n\
The cut-off radius described above can be defined in two ways: \n\
 \n\
  * Define a cut-off radius directly: \n\
 \n\
        [AFLOW_AAPL]CUT_RAD=5.0 \n\
 \n\
    This is also the default value. \n\
 \n\
  * Define the number of coordination shells that should be included in the interaction volume. \n\
    This can be achieved via the CUT_SHELL parameter. \n\
 \n\
        [AFLOW_AAPL]CUT_SHELL=4 \n\
 \n\
    This is also the default value. The cut-off radius is then determined automatically. \n\
 \n\
It is possible to use both parameters. In this case, AAPL determines the cut-off radius based on \n\
the CUT_SHELL parameter and chooses whichever value is greater. \n\
 \n\
7.2.2. Sum Rule Parameters \n\
 \n\
The iterative procedure behind the calculation of the anharmonic IFCs has a few adjustable \n\
parameters. \n\
 \n\
    * The most important parameter is the convergence criterion for the sum rule, which can \n\
      be set using the SUMRULE parameter, e.g.: \n\
 \n\
          [AFLOW_AAPL]SUMRULE=1E-7 \n\
 \n\
      This is also the default value. \n\
 \n\
    * The maximum number of iterations can be set using the parameter SUMRULE_MAX_ITER: \n\
 \n\
          [AFLOW_AAPL]SUMRULE_MAX_ITER=2000 \n\
 \n\
      This is also the default value, which should be more than enough. \n\
 \n\
    * The last adjustable parameter is the mixing coefficient, which controls how much of the \n\
      previous iteration step is mixed into the new IFC values: \n\
 \n\
          [AFLOW_AAPL]MIXING_COEFFICIENT=0.0 \n\
 \n\
      It defaults to 0.0, i.e. there is no mixing between two iteration steps. However, if \n\
      convergence cannot be reached because the corrections are too large, this parameter should \n\
      be adjusted. \n\
 \n\
7.2.3. k-Point Parameters \n\
 \n\
The KPPRA parameter can be set separately for AAPL calculations. This may be desirable to reduce \n\
the computational cost. The parameter to set is KPPRA_AAPL: \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_AAPL]KPPRA_AAPL=1000 \n\
 \n\
If no entry is found or if the parameter is smaller than 1, the KPPRA value for APL will be used. \n\
 \n\
7.3. Lattice Thermal Conductivity Calculations \n\
 \n\
The lattice thermal conductivity tensor is calculated by solving the Boltzmann Transport \n\
Equation (BTE) for a specific temperature range. To set the temperature range, the parameter TCT \n\
needs to be set similar to TPT in APL (see Section 3.3.): \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_AAPL]TCT=50:550:10 \n\
 \n\
The default setting is 50:550:50. The starting temperature cannot be set to 0 K because the thermal \n\
conductivity is infinite. If it is set to 0 K, AAPL will simply skip it. \n\
 \n\
The BTE can be solved using either the Relaxation Time Approximation (RTA) or an iterative \n\
procedure, which is done by the BTE keyword: \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_AAPL]BTE=RTA|FULL \n\
 \n\
The default is BTE=FULL. \n\
 \n\
The BTE gets solved along a q-point grid which can be defined using THERMALGRID: \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_AAPL]THERMALGRID=q1Xq2Xq3 \n\
 \n\
Where q1, q2, and q3 are the number of q-points along each dimension. The default is 26X26X26. \n\
 \n\
There are various factors which can influence the phonon scattering rates besides anharmonic phonon \n\
processes. Two mechanisms that are implemented in AAPL: isotope scattering and grain boundary \n\
scattering. \n\
 \n\
    * Isotope scattering can be switched on by setting the parameter ISOTOPE: \n\
 \n\
          [AFLOW_AAPL]ISOTOPE=ON \n\
 \n\
      The default is ISOTOPE=OFF. \n\
 \n\
    * Grain boundary scattering can be included in two ways: \n\
 \n\
        1. By introducing a grain boundary scattering term into the scattering rate. This is done \n\
           by setting BOUNDARY to true: \n\
 \n\
              [AFLOW_AAPL]BOUNDARY=ON \n\
 \n\
           The default is BOUNDARY=OFF. \n\
 \n\
        2. By only including phonon modes with a mean free path below a threshold into the thermal \n\
           conductivity calculation. This is done using the keyword CUMULATIVEK: \n\
 \n\
               [AFLOW_AAPL]CUMULATIVEK=ON \n\
 \n\
           The default is CUMULATIVEK=OFF. \n\
 \n\
        If both are set to true, BOUNDARY will be used, i.e. CUMULATIVEK will be set to false. \n\
 \n\
        Both methods require an additional parameter, NANO_SIZE: \n\
 \n\
            [AFLOW_AAPL]NANO_SIZE=300 \n\
 \n\
        Which corresponds to the grain size/mean free path threshold in nm. The default is 100 nm. \n\
 \n\

Quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA), QHA-3phonon (QHA3P), and self consistent quasi harmonic (SCQHA)   \n\
(Gruneisen parameter and Equation of state calculations) \n\
Thermal properties calculated using a QHA, QHA3P, and SCQHA model. \n\
This implementation in AFLOW written by Pinku Nath and Stefano Curtarolo, \n\
and is described in the paper \"Computational Materials Science Volume 125, December 2016, Pages 82–91\" and arXiv:1807.04669. \n\
 \n\
 \n\
    Within QHA following properties can be calculated.. \n\
    Gruneisen parameter along high-symmetry path \n\
    Mode Gruneisen in q-mesh \n\
    Average Gruneisen parameter \n\
    Equation of states (Cp, thermal-expansion, Bulk Modulus etc.) \n\
 \n\
    The above mentioned properties can also be calculated with QHA3P and SCQHA. \n\
    In addition to that SCQHA and QHA3P can also calculate Temperature dependent phonon spectra \n\
    which can not be calculated with QHA method.  \n\
 \n\
    In this version QHA, QHA3P and SCQHA can be run alone or together. \n\
 \n\
    This read-me file is divided into following sections: \n\
    SECTION1 ::  All AFLOW options are explained to run QHA, QHA3P and SCQHA \n\
    SECTION2 ::  All output file names \n\
    SECTION3 ::  One example of Si aflow.in to run QHA, QHA3P and SCQHA together \n\
    SECTION4 ::  One example of qsub.sh \n\

Thermal properties calculated using a quasi-harmonic Debye model. \n\
This implementation in AFLOW written by Cormac Toher and Stefano Curtarolo,  \n\
and is described in the papers Phys. Rev. B 90,  90, 174107 (2014) and \n\
Phys. Rev. Materials 1, 015401 (2017). \n\
Based on the GIBBS program, described in the publications \n\
 Computer Physics Communications 158, 57-72 (2004) and \n\
 Journal of Molecular Structure (Theochem) 368, 245-255 (1996). \n\
Please cite the 4 papers mentioned above in addition to the standard AFLOW \n\
papers if you use results obtained using the AFLOW AGL code. \n\
The Hugoniot calculation described in point (18) below was implemented \n\
by Patrick Avery at University of Buffalo (email: psavery@buffalo.edu). \n\
 \n\
The current version of AGL can calculate the thermal conductivity, Debye temperature, \n\
Gruneisen parameter, heat capacity, vibrational free energy, and other thermal properties, \n\
as a function of temperature and pressure. The results are written in a variety of formats \n\
in different output files. The main output file is named aflow.agl.out, and contains the \n\
AGL results for the thermal conductivity at 300K, the traditional and acoustic Debye \n\
temperatures, the Gruneisen parameter, the heat capacities at constant volume (Cv) and \n\
constant pressure (Cp) at 300K, the thermal expansion at 300K, and the static and \n\
isothermal bulk modulus at 300K. It also contains the results for the thermal conductivity, \n\
Debye temperature, Gruneisen parameter, heat capacity, thermal expansion and bulk modulus \n\
as function of temperature; and the Gibbs free energy, vibrational Helmholtz free energy,  \n\
vibrational internal energy, and vibrational entropy as a function of temperature. More \n\
information can be found in the other main ouput file AGL.out, which contains the results \n\
for the thermal properties and bulk moduli for all temperatures and pressures. The values \n\
for the vibrational internal energy, vibrational free energy, entropy, heat capacity, \n\
Debye temperature and Gruneisen parameter as a function of temperature at zero pressure \n\
are written to the file AGL_THERMO, in a similar format to that used by the THERMO file \n\
written by AFLOW APL. For further details on the output files written, see points (16) \n\
and (17) below. Other results can be written and plotted by setting the appropriate \n\
values in the aflow.in file, as described in point (17) below. \n\
Results are also written in JSON format in two files: AGL_energy.json and \n\
AGL_energy_structures.json. The file AGL_energy.json contains the results for \n\
the DFT energy as a function of volume, the enthalpy as a function of pressure, \n\
and the Gibbs free energy as a function of pressure and temperature. The file \n\
AGL_energy_structures.json contains the energies, stresses and pressures for each \n\
calculated structure, as well as the structures themselves and the distortions applied \n\
to them. \n\
 \n\
AFLOW AGL expects a well relaxed structure on input. There is no additional relaxation \n\
inside the AFLOW AGL. So, you have to prepare such a structure by a separate AFLOW run \n\
using a relaxation mode for energy and/or forces.  \n\
 \n\
When AFLOW AGL is run, it will first check for the existence of the required DFT \n\
calculations. If these exist, then it will extract the required information and \n\
proceed to calculate the thermal properties. If these do not exist, then it will \n\
create the required directories and aflow.in files, and then stop. By running AFLOW \n\
with the \"--D\" and \"--multi\" flags, AFLOW will then automatically descend into these \n\
subdirectories and run the required electronic structure calculations, after which \n\
it will stop. The user will then have to rename or delete the LOCK file in the main \n\
directory, and the run AFLOW again to calculate the thermal properties. This \n\
can all be performed within a submission script as in the following example: \n\
 \n\
aflow --multi -D $pathname/ >> log.$PBS_JOBID \n\
mv $pathname/LOCK $pathname/LOCK.old \n\
aflow --multi -D $pathname/ >> log.$PBS_JOBID \n\
 \n\
This procedure is similar to that required to run AFLOW APL. \n\
 \n\
1) To perform a AFLOW AGL calculation the following line has to be present in aflow.in: \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AGL]CALC \n\
 \n\
   AFLOW checks for the existence of this line in aflow.in. If it does not exist, \n\
   then the job is not an AFLOW AGL calculation and no other AGL settings are read.  \n\
 \n\
   AGL can also be run from within other parts of AFLOW, such as from APL, in order to \n\
   obtain properties such as bulk modulus and equilibrium volume as a function of \n\
   temperature to be used within these other parts of AFLOW. In this case, AGL will run \n\
   and the other AGL settings in the aflow.in file will be read, even if the \n\
   \"[AFLOW_AGL]CALC\" line is not present. \n\
 \n\
2) The AFLOW AGL method requires a set of energy vs. volume data, which are obtained \n\
   from DFT calculations of a set of strained structures. The user has the possibility \n\
   to set the number of strained structures and the size of the strain step. These \n\
   parameters can be set by including the following lines in the aflow.in file: \n\
     \n\
   [AFLOW_AGL]NSTRUCTURES=number \n\
   [AFLOW_AGL]STRAIN_STEP=number \n\
 \n\
   The default setting is 28 structures and a step size of 0.01. The strain step size \n\
   corresponds to the value by which each lattice vector is shortened or lengthened for \n\
   each new strained structure. \n\
 \n\
3) The AFLOW AGL method allows the user to select what type of AFLOW DFT runs are performed \n\
   for each strained structure (see Calderon et al., Comp. Mat. Sci. 108A, 233-238 (2015) \n\
   for a description of the parameters used for the different calculation types). The \n\
   default option is to perform an AFLOW STATIC calculation for each strained structure, \n\
   which can be set by including the following lines in the aflow.in file: \n\
    \n\
   [AFLOW_AGL]STATIC=ON \n\
    \n\
   The other option is to run a RELAX_STATIC=2 calculation, which can be set by including  \n\
   the following lines in the aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AGL]RELAX_STATIC=ON \n\
 \n\
4) The AFLOW AGL method allows the user to select which form of the equation of state is \n\
   used to fit the (E, V) data. The options include numerical, Vinet (J. Phys. Condens. \n\
   Matter 1, 1941 (1989)), Birch-Murnaghan and spinodal (Baonza, Caceres, and Nunez, \n\
   Phys. Rev. B 51, 28 (1995)). These options can be selected by including the following \n\
   line in the aflow.in file :		  \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AGL]IEOS=number \n\
 \n\
   The options are as follows: \n\
   IEOS=0: Numerical equation of state (default setting) \n\
   IEOS=1: Vinet equation of state \n\
   IEOS=2: Birch-Murnaghan equation of state \n\
   IEOS=3: Vinet equation fitting, but numerical calculation to obtain thermal properties \n\
   IEOS=4: Birch-Murnaghan equation fitting, but numerical calculation to obtain thermal \n\
   	   properties \n\
   IEOS=5: Spinodal (BCNT) equation of state \n\
   IEOS=6: Spinodal (BCNT) equation fitting, but numerical calculation to obtain thermal \n\
   	   properties \n\
   IEOS=-1: Number equation of state with minimal output, no plots generated or files \n\
   	    other than [system name].out are written \n\
 \n\
   For the spinodal equation of state, the user also has the option to optimize the \n\
   non-linear parameter beta using the following: \n\
   \n\
   [AFLOW_AGL]IOPT_G=number \n\
 \n\
   The options are as follows: \n\
   IOPT_G=0: Beta is fixed to 0.85 \n\
   IOPT_G=1: Beta is always optimized \n\
   IOPT_G=2: Beta is only optimized in the static calculation, and then this value is used \n\
   	     for the finite temperature calculations   \n\
 \n\
5) The AFLOW AGL method allows the user to select whether or not to calculate the Debye \n\
   temperature self-consistently. These options can be selected by including the following \n\
   line in the aflow.in file:	 \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AGL]IDEBYE=number \n\
 \n\
   The options are as follows: \n\
   IDEBYE=0: No self-consistent calculation of Debye temperature, Debye temperature calculated \n\
   	     from static bulk moduli (default) \n\
   IDEBYE=1: User contributed Debye temperatures \n\
   IDEBYE=2: Self-consistent calculation of Debye temperatures from adiabatic bulk moduli \n\
   IDEBYE=3: Debye temperature calculated from static bulk modulus at static equilibrium volume \n\
   IDEBYE=-1: Static calculation only, no finite temperature properties calculated \n\
 \n\
   User contributed Debye temperatures should be given in the following format: \n\
    \n\
   [AFLOW_AGL]DEBYE_TEMP_number=number \n\
 \n\
   The first number is an integer corresponding to the number of the structure, while the second \n\
   number is the user's value of the Debye temperature for this structure. \n\
 \n\
6) The AFLOW AGL method allows the user to choose the details of how the (E, V) curve is fitted by \n\
   a polynomial, and in particularly how convex points in the (E, V) data are accounted for. This \n\
   allows the user to relax the concavity restrictions on the (E, V) data being used. These options \n\
   can be selected by including the following line in the aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AGL]FIT_TYPE=number \n\
 \n\
   The options are as follows: \n\
 \n\
   FIT_TYPE=0: Fits only the first concave section of the (E, V) data. If this does not include the \n\
   	      minimum, it also includes a second concave section starting from the minimum, if such \n\
	      a section exists. This is the default setting. \n\
   FIT_TYPE=1: Fits only (E, V) data points where the energy is monotonically decreasing until the \n\
   	      minimum energy is reached, and points where the energy is monotonically increasing \n\
	      after the minimum energy is reached. \n\
   FIT_TYPE=2: Fits all (E, V) data points. 	       \n\
   FIT_TYPE=3: Selects points using same method as for FIT_TYPE=1, but then fits these points by a \n\
   	      polynomial which is used to generate a new set smoothly concave (E, V) data points. \n\
   FIT_TYPE=4: Fits all points by a polynomial which is used to generate a new set of smoothly \n\
   	      concave (E, V) data points. \n\
   FIT_TYPE=5: The (E, V) data is read in from user-created file instead of being directly extracted \n\
   	      from the results of the electronic structure calculations. \n\
	       \n\
   Note that these fitting options should be used carefully, as they could give misleading results. \n\
   They are mainly useful for testing and debugging, and for in depth exploration of certain properties \n\
   of specific systems. For high-throughput data generation, use only the default option of FIT_TYPE=0, \n\
   as this is the safest. Also, be sure to check for warnings about data points being excluded from the \n\
   calculation. If a lot of points are excluded, you may want to recheck the (E, V) from the original \n\
   electronic structure calculations, and if it is very noisy it would be advisable to rerun these \n\
   calculations with a denser k-point mesh. \n\
 \n\
7) The AFLOW AGL method allows the user to set the value of the Poisson ratio to be used by including \n\
   the following line in the aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AGL]POISSON_RATIO=number \n\
 \n\
   The default value is 0.25. \n\
 \n\
   The AFLOW AGL method can also call the AFLOW AEL method to calculate the Poisson ratio from the \n\
   elastic constants by including the following line in the aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AGL]AEL_POISSON_RATIO=ON    \n\
 \n\
   This option will run the AEL method in full, calculating the Poisson ratio, bulk and shear moduli, \n\
   and other elastic properties. Note that running this method in conjunction with AGL will require \n\
   an additional aflow run  followed by moving the LOCK file to a different location. See the README \n\
   file for AEL for more details on this method.  \n\
 \n\
8) The AFLOW AGL method allows the user to set the number of temperature and pressure points to be used  \n\
   in the calculation, as well as the size of the increments between each temperature or pressure point. \n\
   These values can be set by including the following lines in the aflow.in file:	 \n\
     \n\
   [AFLOW_AGL]NPRESSURE=number \n\
   [AFLOW_AGL]SPRESSURE=number \n\
   [AFLOW_AGL]NTEMP=number \n\
   [AFLOW_AGL]STEMP=number \n\
 \n\
   NPRESSURE is the number of pressure points and SPRESSURE is the increment between pressure points.  \n\
   NTEMP is the number of temperature points and STEMP is the increment between temperature points.  \n\
 \n\
   The current default values are as follows:	 \n\
 \n\
   NPRESSURE=101 \n\
   SPRESSURE=1.0 \n\
   NTEMP=201 \n\
   STEMP=10.0 \n\
 \n\
9) The AFLOW AGL method allows the user to provide specific pressure values to be used in the \n\
   calculations. This option can be selected by including the following line in the aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AGL]SET_PRESSURE_VALUE=ON \n\
 \n\
   Setting this option results in the specific pressure values being read in from the aflow.in file. \n\
   The default value is SETPRESSUREVALUE=OFF so that no specific values are read in. User specified \n\
   pressure values should be provided using the following format: \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AGL]PRESSURE_number=number \n\
 \n\
   Note that the first pressure value should always be equal to 0.0. If this is not the case, \n\
   AFLOW AGL will give a warning and insert a value of 0.0 as the first pressure value. Also, \n\
   negative pressure values will result in AFLOW AGL exiting with an error. \n\
 \n\
10) The AFLOW AGL method allows the user to set the maximum number of convergence iterations \n\
    for the Gauss-Legendre and self-consistent Debye functions. This limit prevents these \n\
    functions from getting stuck in an infinite loop. This value can be set by including the \n\
    following line in the aflow.in file: \n\
    \n\
   [AFLOW_AGL]MAX_LOOPS=number \n\
 \n\
   The default value is 250. \n\
 \n\
11) The AFLOW AGL method allows the user to set the value of the energy for an infinite volume.  \n\
   The purpose of this is to set the zero of the energy scale. \n\
   This value can be set by including the following line in the aflow.in file:	 \n\
   \n\
   [AFLOW_AGL]EINF=number \n\
 \n\
   The default value is 0.0. \n\
 \n\
12) The AFLOW AGL method allows the user to choose whether or not to write out the input file for \n\
   the original, non-AFLOW version of GIBBS. This can be useful for debugging and testing.  \n\
   This option can be selected by including the following line in the aflow.in file:	 \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AGL]WRITE_GIBBS_INPUT=option \n\
 \n\
   The AGL input will be written for WRITE_GIBBS_INPUT=ON. The default value is WRITE_GIBBS_INPUT=OFF, \n\
   which does not write out the file. \n\
 \n\
13) The AFLOW AGL method allows the user to choose whether or not to check the concavity and \n\
    location of the energy minimum of the (E, V) data calculated with VASP before starting the \n\
    GIBBS method. In order to fit the (E, V) data by a polynomial, the data points should be \n\
    concave and include a minimum. This option can be selected by including the following line \n\
    in the aflow.in file:	 \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOWGIBBS]CHECK_EV_CONCAVITY=option \n\
 \n\
    A value of CHECK_EV_CONCAVITY=ON causes the concavity check to be performed. The default value \n\
    is CHECK_EV_CONCAVITY=OFF so no concavity check is performed prior to the GIBBS method. The GIBBS \n\
    method will perform another concavity check after the (E, V) data has been passed to it, and \n\
    will return an error if the data is not concave.  \n\
 \n\
    Problems with the (E, V) data are usually the result of incompleteness of the electronic \n\
    structure calculation basis set or k-point grid. If CHECK_EV_CONCAVITY=ON and if the (E, V) \n\
    data is not concave, then AFLOW AGL doubles value of KPPRA to increase the number of k-points, \n\
    and creates a new set of directories containing aflow.in files with this new value of KPPRA. \n\
    The electronuc structure calculations are rerun with the increased number of k-points, and \n\
    the new set of (E, V) data is once again checked for concavity. This process is repeated until \n\
    a concave data set is obtained or the maximum number of concavity check iterations is reached. \n\
    The number of concavity check iterations can be set by including the following line in the \n\
    aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_AGL]MAX_CC_ITER=number \n\
 \n\
    The default value for the maximum number of concavity check iterations is 1. \n\
 \n\
    The AFLOW AGL method allows the user to choose whether or not to check that the (E, V) data \n\
    set includes the energy minimum. In order to get a good fit, the (E, V) data should contain \n\
    the minimum. This check can be initiated by including the following line in the aflow.in file:	 \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_AGL]CHECK_EV_MIN=option \n\
 \n\
    A value of CHECK_EV_MIN=ON causes the check of the location of the energy minimum to be performed.  \n\
    The default value is CHECK_EV_MIN=OFF so no check is performed.  \n\
 \n\
    If CHECK_EV_MIN=ON, the (E, V) data is sorted in order of increasing volume. If the lowest energy \n\
    in the data set corresponds to the smallest or largest volume, then the (E, V) data set does \n\
    not include the minimum. Additional strained structures are then created until the (E, V) data \n\
    includes a minimum or the maximum number of minimum check iterations is reached. The number of \n\
    minimum check iterations can be set by including the following line in the aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_AGL]MAX_CM_ITER=number \n\
 \n\
    The default value for the maximum number of minimum position check iterations is 5. \n\
 \n\
14) Since multiple different volume calculations are performed for a given system, there is a \n\
    certain amount of redundancy towards the failure of some of these calculations, and therefore \n\
    options have been implemented within AGL to allow for the skipping of one or more failed run. \n\
    Failed runs can be detected automatically (by the absence of the appropriate LOCK or OUTCAR \n\
    file in the directory), and the option of whether or not to skip these runs can be set by \n\
    including the following line in the aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AGL]AUTOSKIP_FAILED_ARUNS=option \n\
 \n\
   The default is \"OFF\" so that no runs are skipped automatically; instead detection of a failed \n\
   run will cause AGL to exit with an error unless this particular run was explicitly listed to \n\
   be skipped. \n\
 \n\
   Specific runs can be listed for skipping by including the following line in the aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AGL]SKIP_FAILED_ARUNS=directory_name_list \n\
 \n\
   where \"directory_name_list\" is a string with the list of directory names containing the failed \n\
   runs to be skipped by the AGL fitting algorithm. If there is more than one failed run, the \n\
   individual directory names should be listed on the same line, separated by commas. \n\
 \n\
   AGL only permits a certain number of runs to be skipped. The maximum number of runs permitted \n\
   to be skipped can be set by including the following line in the aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AGL]SKIP_ARUNS_MAX=number \n\
 \n\
   The default value is 7, so that up to seven runs can be skipped.  \n\
 \n\
15) The AFLOW AGL method will automatically calculate the thermal conductivity at the acoustic \n\
    Debye temperature and as a function of temperature using the equation originally derived by \n\
    Slack (see Glen A. Slack, Solid State Physics 34, 1-75 (1979) for original method and \n\
    C. Toher et al., Phys. Rev. B 90, 174107 (2014) and Phys. Rev. Materials 1, 015401 (2017) \n\
    for more details; these references also describe the acoustic Debye temperature). This \n\
    calculation is always switched on.  \n\
     \n\
    The thermal conductivity can also be calculated with this equation as a function of \n\
    temperature using the equilibrium volume as a function of temperature by including \n\
    the following line in the aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_AGL]KAPPA_VOLUME=option \n\
 \n\
    The thermal conductivity will be calculated using the equilibrium volume as a function \n\
    of temperature for KAPPA_VOLUME=ON, and the results are written to the file \n\
    \"AGL_thermal_properties_temperature_vol.dat\". The default value is KAPPA_VOLUME=OFF, \n\
    which only calculates the thermal conductivity using the equilibrium volume at the \n\
    acoustic Debye temperature. \n\
 \n\
    The user can also provide values to AGL for the acoustic Debye temperature and the \n\
    Gruneisen parameter to be used in calculating the thermal conductivity by including \n\
    the lines: \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_AGL]THETA_COND=number \n\
    [AFLOW_AGL]GRUNEISEN=number \n\
 \n\
    If both of these lines are present, the thermal conductivity is calculated with the \n\
    Slack equation using the values provided by the user, and the results are written in \n\
    the \"AGL_thermal_conductivity_user_lib.dat\". This can be useful for comparing AGL \n\
    results to values in the literature for the purpose of debugging and testing the \n\
    AGL code. \n\
 \n\
16) The main output file for AFLOW AGL is aflow.agl.out. It contains the AGL results \n\
    for the thermal conductivity at 300K, the traditional and acoustic Debye temperatures, \n\
    the Gruneisen parameter, the heat capacities at constant volume (Cv) and constant \n\
    pressure (Cp) at 300K, the thermal expansion at 300K, and the static and isothermal \n\
    bulk modulus at 300K, as well as recording the source and value of the Poisson ratio \n\
    used to calculate the Debye temperature. It also contains the results for the thermal \n\
    conductivity, Debye temperature, Gruneisen parameter, heat capacity, thermal expansion \n\
    and bulk modulus as function of temperature; and the Gibbs free energy, vibrational \n\
    Helmholtz free energy, vibrational internal energy, and vibrational entropy as a \n\
    function of temperature. \n\
 \n\
17) The AFLOW AGL method allows the user to choose whether or not to automatically create \n\
    plots of the results for the Debye temperature, heat capacity, Gruneisen parameter, and \n\
    vibrational free energy as a function of temperature; as well as the energies obtained \n\
    from the DFT calculations as a function of volume per atom and volume per cell. These \n\
    plots are in saved as different formats depending on the input given by the user. The \n\
    plots are stored in the files <sysname>_debye_temperature.*, <sysname>_heat_capacity.*, \n\
    <sysname>_gruneisen_parameter.*, <sysname>_vibrational_free_energy.*, \n\
    <sysname>__energy_volume_atom.* and <sysname>__energy_volume_cell.*; \n\
    where \"*\" is dependent on the format in which the files are saved and <sysname> is \n\
    the name given to the material system being calculated. These results can be plotted \n\
    by including the following line in the aflow.in file:	 \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_AGL]PLOT_RESULTS=option \n\
 \n\
    If PLOT_RESULTS=ON, then the plots are generated with gnuplot. The default option is \n\
    PLOT_RESULTS=OFF so that no plots are generated. Which files are kept and which formats \n\
    are used to save the plots depends on the options used to run AFLOW. In particular, \n\
    the \"--keep\" option controls whether or not the gnuplot script (\"--keep=gnuplot\") \n\
    and the eps file (\"--keep=eps\") are saved instead of deleted. The plots can be saved \n\
    in other file formats including png, pdf, jpeg and gif using the options \"--keep=png\", \n\
    \"--keep=pdf\", \"--keep=jpg\" and \"--keep=gif\", respectively. \n\
 \n\
    If [AFLOW_AGL]IEOS=-1 or [AFLOW_AGL]IDEBYE=-1, then the plotting of these properties \n\
    is skipped. \n\
     \n\
    The AFLOW AGL method also allows the user to choose whether to write additional output \n\
    files. These additional output files include the file Debye_temperature.dat, which \n\
    writes the Debye temperature, heat capacity, vibrational free energy and Gruneisen \n\
    parameter as a function of temperature in a format which is easy to plot using commonly \n\
    available graphing software such as xmgrace. This file can be written by including the \n\
    following entry in the aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_AGL]WRITE_FULL_RESULTS=option \n\
 \n\
    The additional output files are written if WRITE_FULL_RESULTS=ON. The default value is \n\
    WRITE_FULL_RESULTS=OFF, i.e. the additional output files are not written. When this option \n\
    is active, the values of the Debye temperature, heat capacity, vibrational free energy \n\
    and Gruneisen parameter at certain temperatures are written in the file Debye_summary.dat. \n\
    These temperature values correspond to methods most often used in the literature to \n\
    determine which temperature value is used for the Debye temperature or heat capacity being \n\
    reported. If [AFLOW_AGL]IEOS=-1 or [AFLOW_AGL]IDEBYE=-1, then the writing of these files \n\
    is skipped. The specific temperature values are determined as follows: \n\
 \n\
    - Best fit of Debye temperature to heat capacity: \n\
    The first temperature value is determined from the value of the Debye temperature which \n\
    produces the best fit to the heat capacity curve calculated using AGL. The heat capacity \n\
    curve is fitted using the following equation: \n\
 \n\
    c_V = 9 n k_B (\\frac{T}{Theta_D})^3 \\int_0^{Theta_D / T} \\frac{x^4 e^x}{(e^x - 1)^2} dx \n\
 \n\
    Here, c_V is the heat capacity at constant volume, n is the number of atoms in the unit \n\
    cell, k_B is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, and Theta_D is the Debye temperature. \n\
    This equation is the same as that given in  equation 23.26 in Solid State Physics, Ashcroft and \n\
    Mermin (1976). The temperature value at which this value of the Debye temperature is produced \n\
    by AGL is also written, along with the heat capacity, vibrational free energy, and \n\
    Gruneisen parameter at this temperature.  \n\
 \n\
    - Temperature where heat capacity is half Dulong-Petit value \n\
    At high temperatures, the heat capacity tends to a limit given by 3 n k_B, where n is the \n\
    number of atoms per unit cell and k_B is the Debye temperature. This is known as the \n\
    Dulong-Petit value. The second temperature value is determined from the point at which the \n\
    heat capacity is equal to half of this value, i.e. 1.5 n k_B. This method was used to determine \n\
    the Debye temperatures listed in table 23.3 in Solid State Physics, Ashcroft and Mermin (1976). \n\
 \n\
    - Minimum value of Debye temperature \n\
    The third temperature value used it that at which the Debye temperature calculated \n\
    using the AGL method is a minimum. \n\
 \n\
    - Maximum value of Debye temperature \n\
    The fourth temperature value used it that at which the Debye temperature calculated \n\
    using the AGL method is a maximum. \n\
 \n\
    - 300K (~room temperature) \n\
    The final temperature used is 300K, which corresponds approximately to room temperature.  \n\
 \n\
    Finally, the values of the Debye temperature, Gruneisen parameter and vibrational free \n\
    energy for the temperatures corresponding to the best fit to the heat capacity, the half \n\
    Dulong-Petit value of the heat capacity, and 300K (~room temperature), respectively, are \n\
    written in a script-parsable format in the file agllib.dat. The format used is  \n\
    the same as that used for the file aflowlib_entry.out. \n\
 \n\
18) The energy and mass density data as a function of temperature and pressure generated \n\
    by AGL can be used calculate the Hugoniot relation for the material. It finds the energy (E) \n\
    and mass density (rho) at each pressure (P) and temperature so that the following Hugoniot \n\
    expression is true: \n\
 \n\
    E - E0 = 0.5 * (P + P0)*(1.0/rho0 - 1.0/rho) \n\
 \n\
    where E0, P0 and rho0 are the reference energy, pressure and mass density for the material \n\
    (typically the values at room temperature and pressure). The Hugoniot relation can be \n\
    calculated using AGL by including the following line in the aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_AGL]HUGONIOT_CALC=option \n\
 \n\
    If HUGONIOT_CALC=ON, then the Hugoniot calculation is performed and the results are written \n\
    to the file AGL_Hugoniot.out. The default option is HUGONIOT_CALC=ON so that the Hugoniot \n\
    calculation is performed automatically; this can be switched off by setting HUGONIOT_CALC=OFF. \n\
 \n\
    If the solution of the Hugoniot relation is outside the range of calculated range, then an  \n\
    extrapolation can be performed by including the following line in the aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_AGL]HUGONIOT_EXTRAPOLATE=option \n\
     \n\
    If HUGONIOT_EXTRAPOLATE=ON, then the Hugoniot extrapolation is performed. The default option is  \n\
    HUGONIOT_EXTRAPOLATE=OFF so that the Hugoniot extrapolation is not performed. \n\
 \n\
19) By default, if AGL cannot find a minimum of the energy at a particular temperature and pressure, \n\
    then it will truncate the pressure range so that it only runs up to that point. If this happens \n\
    at zero pressure, then the temperature range will also be truncated. This can be problematic \n\
    when trying to explore the high pressure/high temperature regime. Instead, the option to skip \n\
    over these points rather than truncate the pressure and temperature ranges can be selected by \n\
    including the following line in the aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_AEL]RUN_ALL_PRESSURE_TEMPERATURE=option \n\
 \n\
    If this option is set to \"ON\", then it will skip over the pressure and temperature points where \n\
    it cannot find a minimum energy, saving the values of the thermodynamic quantities in a C++ struct. \n\
    When this option is set to \"ON\", many of the usual output files are not written, since many of the \n\
    usual quantities are not saved in the usual format, due to the skipping of pressure and temperature \n\
    points. The output files that are written are the AGL_energy.json file and AGL_energy_structures.json \n\
    files, where the thermodynamic properties for each pressure and temperature are stored in individual \n\
    JSON objects along with the corresponding temperature and pressure values. \n\
 \n\
    If the option HUGONIOT_CALC=ON is selected but RUN_ALL_PRESSURE_TEMPERATURE=OFF, then AGL will automatically \n\
    check if the pressure or temperature ranges were truncated during the GIBBS algorithm. If they have been \n\
    truncated, then AGL will re-run the GIBBS algorithm with RUN_ALL_PRESSURE_TEMPERATURE=ON, so that the entire \n\
    requested pressure and temperature range is explored. Note that since all of the output files except for \n\
    the AGL_energy.json and AGL_Hugoniot.out files have already been written at this point, this does not \n\
    affect the writing of the other output files, and thus will result in the writing of all of the output \n\
    files that would normally be written.     \n\
 \n\
20) Electronic properties as a function of pressure are automatically extracted from the electronic density \n\
    of states in the VASP DOSCAR files. The band gap (in the case of insulators and semiconductors) and  \n\
    the value of the DOS at the Fermi energy (in the case of metals) as a function of pressure are calculated \n\
    and written in the files AGL_edos_gap_pressure.out and AGL_edos_gap_pressure.json. The band gap and  \n\
    the DOS at the Fermi energy as a function of pressure are fitted by polynomials, and the evaluated values \n\
    at each pressure are also written to these files. The polynomials are used to calculated the derivative  \n\
    with respect to pressure of the band gap and DOS at zero pressure, which is used to quantify the  \n\
    sensitivity of the electronic structure to applied strains and pressure. These derivatives, along with \n\
    the minimum and maximum values of the DOS and band gap, are also written in the files  \n\
    AGL_edos_gap_pressure.out and AGL_edos_gap_pressure.json.		 \n\

Elastic properties calculated directly from stress-strain data. \n\
This implementation in AFLOW written by Cormac Toher and Stefano Curtarolo,  \n\
and is described in the paper Phys. Rev. Materials 1, 015401 (2017), \n\
and is developed from the method described in Scientific Data 2, 150009 (2015). \n\
Please cite the papers mentioned above in addition to the standard AFLOW papers  \n\
if you use results obtained using the AFLOW AEL code. \n\
 \n\
The current version of AEL can calculate the Poisson ratio, bulk modulus, shear modulus, \n\
compliance tensor and stiffness tensor (elastic constants). The results are written in a \n\
variety of formats in different output files. For further details on the output files \n\
written, see points (9) and (10) below. Other results can be written and plotted by \n\
setting the appropriate values in the aflow.in file, as described in point (10) below. \n\
 \n\
AFLOW AEL expects a well relaxed structure on input. There is no additional relaxation \n\
of the cell shape and size inside the AFLOW AEL, only of the ion positions. So, you \n\
have to prepare such a structure by a separate AFLOW run using a relaxation mode for \n\
energy and/or forces.  \n\
 \n\
When AFLOW AEL is run, it will first check for the existence of the required DFT \n\
calculations. If these exist, then it will extract the required information and \n\
proceed to calculate the thermal properties. If these do not exist, then it will \n\
create the required directories and aflow.in files, and then stop. By running AFLOW \n\
with the \"--D\" and \"--multi\" flags, AFLOW will then automatically descend into these \n\
subdirectories and run the required electronic structure calculations, after which it \n\
will stop. The user will then have to rename or delete the LOCK file in the main \n\
directory, and the run AFLOW again to calculate the thermal properties. This can all \n\
be performed within a submission script as in the following example: \n\
 \n\
aflow --multi -D $pathname/ >> log.$PBS_JOBID \n\
mv $pathname/LOCK $pathname/LOCK.old \n\
aflow --multi -D $pathname/ >> log.$PBS_JOBID \n\
 \n\
This procedure is similar to that required to run AFLOW APL and AFLOW AGL. \n\
 \n\
1) To perform a AFLOW AEL calculation the following line has to be present in aflow.in: \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AEL]CALC \n\
 \n\
   AFLOW checks for the existence of this line in aflow.in. If it does not exist, then \n\
   the job is not an AFLOW AEL calculation and no other AEL settings are read.  \n\
 \n\
   AEL can also be run from within other parts of AFLOW, such as from AGL, in order to \n\
   obtain properties such as Poisson ratio to be used within these other parts of AFLOW. \n\
   In this case, AEL will run and the other AEL settings in the aflow.in file will be \n\
   read, even if the \"[AFLOW_AEL]CALC\" line is not present. \n\
 \n\
2) The AFLOW AEL method requires a set of stress vs. strain data, which are obtained \n\
   from DFT calculations of a set of strained structures. There are two types of strains: \n\
   normal strains and shear strains. For each strain type, there are up to three \n\
   independent strain directions. The user has the possibility to set the number of \n\
   strained structures in each direction, and the size of the strain step, for each \n\
   type of strain. These parameters can be set by including the following lines in \n\
   the aflow.in file: \n\
     \n\
   [AFLOW_AEL]NNORMAL_STRAINS=number \n\
   [AFLOW_AEL]NSHEAR_STRAINS=number \n\
   [AFLOW_AEL]NORMAL_STRAIN_STEP=number \n\
   [AFLOW_AEL]SHEAR_STRAIN_STEP=number \n\
 \n\
   The default setting is 4 strains in each direction and a step size of 0.005. The \n\
   default is to apply both positive and negative strains, i.e. to both stretch and \n\
   compress the lattice. This can be controlled by including the following line in \n\
   the aflow.in file:   \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AEL]NEG_STRAINS=option \n\
 \n\
   A value of \"ON\" uses both positive and negative strains, while a value of \"OFF\" \n\
   uses positive strains only. \n\
 \n\
3) The AFLOW AEL method can use the symmetry of the lattice to reduce the number \n\
   of independent strains required for an elasticity calculation. For example, for \n\
   lattices with cubic symmetry, the three orthogonal directions are equivalent so \n\
   that there is only one independent strain direction for each type of strain. The \n\
   number of strain directions can be set automatically by including the following \n\
   line in the aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AEL]STRAIN_SYMMETRY=option \n\
 \n\
   The default is \"OFF\" so that all three directions are treated as independent for \n\
   each strain type. The number of independent strain directions can also be set \n\
   directly by the user by including the following line in the aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AEL]NIND_STRAINDIRS=number \n\
 \n\
   The default value for the number of strain directions is three for each type of \n\
   strain. \n\
 \n\
   The lattice symmetry can also be used to check the elastic constant tensor \n\
   calculated by AFLOW AEL. If the tensor does not have the correct symmetry, \n\
   AFLOW AEL will issue a warning for the user. This can be controlled by including \n\
   the following line in the aflow.in file:   \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AEL]CHECK_ELASTIC_SYMMETRY=option    \n\
    \n\
   The default is \"ON\" so that the symmetry check is performed. The tolerance used \n\
   for checking the symmetry can be set by including the following line in the aflow.in \n\
   file:   \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AEL]SYM_TOL_FRAC=number \n\
 \n\
   The default value is 0.05, and refers to the fractional difference allowed between \n\
   two values which should be equal.    \n\
 \n\
4) The AFLOW AEL method allows to choose whether or not to calculate and/or fit the \n\
   stress for the zero-strain system. The stress tensor for the zero-strain system can \n\
   be calculated by including the following line in the aflow.in file:   \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AEL]ORIGIN_STRAIN_CALC=option \n\
 \n\
   The default is \"OFF\" so that the zero-strain system is not calculated. The zero-strain \n\
   stress can be included in the fitting points used to obtain the elastic constants by \n\
   including the following line in the aflow.in file:   \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AEL]ORIGIN_STRAIN_FIT=option \n\
 \n\
   The default is \"OFF\" so that the zero-strain system is not calculated. Note that if \n\
   the zero-strain system is fitted without the stress being explicitly calculated, \n\
   AFLOW AEL will use values of 0.0 for all elements of the stress tensor. This requires \n\
   the system to be very well relaxed (including cell size and shape) prior to the AEL \n\
   run in order to be valid. \n\
 \n\
   The stress-strain data from a previous AFLOW relaxation can also be fitted by including \n\
   the following line in the aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AEL]RELAXED_STRUCT_FIT=option \n\
    \n\
   The default is \"OFF\" so that the previously relaxed system is not calculated. Note \n\
   that this keyword requires that the results of a full AFLOW relaxation run be present \n\
   in the directory in which is AEL calculation is being run. This keyword is useful if \n\
   such a relaxation already exists, so that an additional point can be added to the \n\
   stress-strain data for the fit without the need for additional DFT calculations. \n\
 \n\
5) The PREC and ALGO settings for the VASP calculations for the strained systems are set \n\
   to ACCURATE and NORMAL by default. These values are chosen as tests of the AFLOW AEL \n\
   method has shown that these settings produce the most reliable results. To read the \n\
   values for PREC and ALGO from the original aflow.in file, the following line should \n\
   be included in the aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AEL]PRECACC_ALGONORM=option \n\
  \n\
   The default is \"OFF\" so that the PREC and ALGO settings in the initial aflow.in file \n\
   are ignored and the setting of PREC=ACCURATE and ALGO=NORMAL are used.   \n\
 \n\
6) The stress tensor for a particular deformed system as calculated with VASP can be \n\
   read from either the OUTCAR file or from the vasprun.xml file. The stress tensor \n\
   can be read from the vasprun.xml file by including the following line in the aflow.in \n\
   file:   \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AEL]VASPRUNXML_STRESS=option \n\
 \n\
   The default is \"OFF\" so that the stress tensor is read from the OUTCAR file. \n\
 \n\
7) The AFLOW AEL method allows the user to control what type of AFLOW runs are used to \n\
   calculate the stress tensor for each strained structure, independently of the [VASP_RUN] \n\
   setting contained in the original aflow.in file. The possible settings are RELAX=2, \n\
   RELAX_STATIC=2, and STATIC, and can be set by including the following lines in the \n\
   aflow.in file respectively: \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AEL]RELAX=option \n\
   [AFLOW_AEL]RELAX_STATIC=option \n\
   [AFLOW_AEL]STATIC=option \n\
    \n\
   The default is RELAX_STATIC=ON, which runs RELAX_STATIC=2 for each strained structure.  \n\
 \n\
8) Since multiple calculations are performed for each independent direction, there is a \n\
   certain amount of redundancy towards the failure of some of these calculations, and \n\
   therefore options have been implemented within AEL to allow for the skipping of one \n\
   or more failed run in each independent direction. Failed runs can be detected \n\
   automatically (by the absence of the appropriate LOCK or OUTCAR file in the directory), \n\
   and the option of whether or not to skip these runs can be set by including the \n\
   following line in the aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AEL]AUTOSKIP_FAILED_ARUNS=option \n\
 \n\
   The default is \"OFF\" so that no runs are skipped automatically; instead detection of \n\
   a failed run will cause AEL to exit with an error unless this particular run was \n\
   explicitly listed to be skipped. \n\
 \n\
   Specific runs can be listed for skipping by including the following line in the aflow.in \n\
   file: \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AEL]SKIP_FAILED_ARUNS=directory_name_list \n\
 \n\
   where \"directory_name_list\" is a string with the list of directory names containing the \n\
   failed runs to be skipped by the AEL fitting algorithm. If there is more than one failed \n\
   run, the individual directory names should be listed on the same line, separated by commas. \n\
 \n\
   AEL only permits a certain number of runs for any given independent strain direction to \n\
   be skipped. The maximum number of runs permitted to be skipped in any strain direction \n\
   can be set by including the following line in the aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
   [AFLOW_AEL]SKIP_ARUNS_MAX=number \n\
 \n\
   The default value is 1, so that only one run can be skipped per independent direction. \n\
   Note that there is also a hard limit on the number of runs in a given direction which \n\
   can be skipped which is equal to half of the initial number of runs set up in that \n\
   direction. \n\
 \n\
9) The main output file for the AEL method is aflow.ael.out. It contains the AEL results \n\
   for the Poisson ratio, bulk modulus (Voigt, Reuss, and Voigt-Reuss-Hill (VRH)), shear \n\
   modulus (Voigt, Reuss, and Voigt-Reuss-Hill (VRH)), speed of sound, AEL Debye temperature, \n\
   and elastic anisotropy. It also contains the elastic constants in the form of the stiffness \n\
   tensor and the compliance tensor. \n\
   Results are also written in JSON format in three files: AEL_elastic_tensor.json and \n\
   AEL_energy_structures.json. The file AEL_elastic_tensor.json contains the elastic \n\
   constants in the form of the individual elements of the stiffness and compliance \n\
   tensors. The file AEL_energy_structures.json contains the energies, stresses and pressures \n\
   for each calculated structure, as well as the structures themselves and the distortions \n\
   applied to them. \n\
 \n\
10) The AFLOW AEL method allows the user to choose whether or not to automatically write \n\
    the directional elastic moduli (Young's moduli, etc.) to a file. The writing of this \n\
    file can be controlled by including the following entry in the aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_AEL]WRITE_FULL_RESULTS=option \n\
 \n\
    The default is \"OFF\", so that these tensors are not written. \n\
 \n\
    Finally, the values of the Poisson ratio, bulk modulus, shear modulus and elastic \n\
    anisotropy are written in a script-parsable format in the file aellib.dat. The format \n\
    used is the same as that used for the file aflowlib_entry.out. The elastic constants \n\
    (in the form of the stiffness and compliance tensor) are also written to files \n\
    independently of the value of the WRITE_FULL_RESULTS setting. \n\
 \n\
11) The elastic properties can be calculated at different pressures using AEL, which is \n\
    useful for determining the pressure range in which a material is mechanically stable. \n\
    This calculation is controlled by including the following line in the aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_AEL]PRESSURE_CALC=option \n\
 \n\
    The default is \"OFF\", so that the elastic properties are only calculated at zero \n\
    pressure. \n\
 \n\
    If this option is set to \"ON\", AEL will call AGL to run a set of different volume \n\
    calculations, to determine the pressure as a function of cell volume. This data is \n\
    then used to determine the cell volumes corresponding to the required pressures. \n\
    These pressures are provided by using the AGL pressure stepsize and number of \n\
    pressure steps options: \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_AGL]SPRESSURE=number \n\
    [AFLOW_AGL]NPRESSURE=number \n\
 \n\
    Specific pressures can also be specified for the AEL pressure calculations, \n\
    independently of the AGL calculations, by including the following line in the \n\
    aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_AEL]SPRESSURE=number \n\
    [AFLOW_AEL]NPRESSURE=number \n\
 \n\
    Using this option allows a different set of pressures to be using for calculating \n\
    the elastic constants than for the final AGL postprocessing, within a single \n\
    ingetrated workflow. \n\
 \n\
    Once the appropriate volumes are determined from the AGL calculations, AEL then \n\
    generates the appropriate normal and shear strained structures, and calculates \n\
    the stress tensors with DFT. The elastic properties at different pressures are \n\
    then written in the file aflow.ael_pressure.out. The output data includes a \n\
    statement of whether or not the material is mechanically stable at each pressure. \n\
 \n\
    Note that this method will only guarantee that the cell pressure will only have \n\
    the set value prior to any relaxation performed. Relaxing the ion positions, as \n\
    is the default for AEL, could result in a change in the cell pressure. Using the \n\
    STATIC option will prevent any relaxation, and will ensure that the set pressure \n\
    is obtained, although this will result in the \"clamped ion\" elastic tensor being \n\
    obtained. \n\
 \n\
    Elastic properties calculated at a finite pressure where the materials is stable \n\
    can be used in other parts of the code by including the following line in the \n\
    aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_AEL]USE_STABLE_PRESSURE=option \n\
 \n\
    If this option is set to \"ON\", then the elastic properties at the lowest \n\
    calculated pressure where the material is elastically stable will be \n\
    set as the main elastic properties for this material: these values \n\
    will be written to the main aflow.ael.out file, this value of the \n\
    Poisson ratio will be used if requested by AGL, etc. The default value \n\
    is \"OFF\", so that the elastic properties calculated at zero pressure \n\
    are used. \n\
 \n\
12) The elastic tensor can be symmetrized after calculation. This option can be selected \n\
    by including the following line in the aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_AEL]SYMMETRIZE=option \n\
 \n\
    The default is \"OFF\", so that the elastic tensor is not symmetrized. If the elastic tensor \n\
    is asymmetric, AEL will give a warning, and the user may want to symmetrize the tensor. \n\
    If the option is set to \"ON\", then the tensor is symmetrized according to the following \n\
    equation: \n\
 \n\
       sc_{ij} = (c_{ij} + c_{ji}) / 2 \n\
 \n\
    where c_{ij} are the elements of the unsymmetrized tensor, and sc_{ij} are the elements of \n\
    the symmetrized tensor. \n\
 \n\
13) The symmetry for the VASP calculations for the strained structures can be switched on and off \n\
    by including the following line in the aflow.in file: \n\
 \n\
    [AFLOW_AEL]VASPSYM=option \n\
 \n\
    The default is \"OFF\", so that the VASP symmetry is switched off (sets SYM=0 in the INCAR file). \n\
    This is because the VASP symmetry routines can have problems with the distorted cells used for \n\
    calculating the elastic tensor. Setting this option to \"ON\" switches on the VASP symmetry.  \n\
 \n\
14) EXAMPLE:  CaO FCC with default AEL settings (note that this will give the same results if all of the \"[AFLOW_AEL]\"  \n\
   lines except \"[AFLOW_AEL]CALC\" are removed or commented out): \n\

 \n\
 \n\
The AFLOW/ANRL Library consists of 590 (part 1: 288, part 2: 302) crystallographic prototypes from the papers listed above.  \n\
These prototypes have been programmed into AFLOW. The list of prototypes and how to call them can be  \n\
found in aflow_anrl.cpp. The prototypes are generally listed in the order they appear in the  \n\
paper (low space group number to high space group number). \n\
 \n\
Note: This implementation of the geometric prototypes allows for the creation of different  \n\
structure prototypes depending on the parameters chosen. Therefore, these prototypes are quite  \n\
general and powerful. \n\
 \n\
 \n\
The general format for the command is as follows (optional arguments are enclosed in square brackets \"[]\"): \n\
 \n\
  aflow --proto=label:A:B:C... --params=a,b/a,c/a,alpha,beta,gamma,x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2,... [--hex] [--vasp|--aims|--qe|--abinit|--wyccar] [--add_equations|--equations_only] \n\
 \n\
Example: \n\
 \n\
  aflow --proto=ABC4_oP12_16_ag_cd_2u --params=5.61,1.01069518717,1.61319073084,0.2,0.26,0.125,0.74,0.8,0.63 \n\
 \n\
 \n\
Particular structure prototypes from the AFLOW Library can be generated with a short-hand alias,  \n\
rather than explicitly providing the parameters with --params (new feature as of V3.1.220).   \n\
 \n\
For prototypes with no degrees of freedom (other than the lattice parameter), the alias is the  \n\
label itself, since there is no other possible structure that is generated from this label. \n\
  Example: quaternary Heusler \n\
 \n\
    aflow --proto=ABCD_cF16_216_c_d_b_a \n\
 \n\
  The Wyckoff positions do not contain any variables. \n\
 \n\
For prototypes with degrees of freedom, the alias is the label and a number. \n\
  Example: A_hR2_166_c (two degrees of freedom) has three structures in the library \n\
 \n\
    aflow --proto=A_hR2_166_c-001 :    rhombohedral graphite \n\
    aflow --proto=A_hR2_166_c-002 :    alpha-As \n\
    aflow --proto=A_hR2_166_c-003 :    beta-O \n\
 \n\
The alias scheme uses the atomic scaled volume - as opposed to the ANRL lattice parameter -  \n\
for more \"realistic\" volumes when decorating with different atomic species.   \n\
To force the ANRL defined lattice parameter, add the following flag to the  \n\
command: --use_anrl_lattice_parameter. \n\
 \n\
 \n\
A description of each input is described below: \n\
 \n\
  label:      The label is a string that provides a great deal of information regarding the  \n\
              geometric prototype. The information is separated by underscores into different  \n\
              fields. \n\
                - Field 1: Stoichiometry             \n\
                - Field 2: Pearson symbol             \n\
                - Field 3: Space group number            \n\
                - Field 4: Wyckoff letters (in alphabetic order) associated with species A \n\
                - Field 5: Wyckoff letters (in alphabetic order) associated with species B \n\
                - Field 6: Wyckoff letters (in alphabetic order) associated with species C \n\
                -  ... \n\
                -  ... \n\
                -  ... \n\
 \n\
  A:B:C...:   The prototype can be decorated with different atoms by appending the elements  \n\
              to the label separated by colons \":\". \n\
 \n\
  parameters: The parameters are necessary to create the structure prototype. \n\
              The parameter information is separated by commas. The parameters are  \n\
              type double, which specify the degrees of freedom in the prototype.  \n\
 \n\
                - a,b/a,c/a :        Magnitudes of lattice vectors. Note, there may not be a need  \n\
                                     to specify all magnitudes, since higher symmetry prototypes \n\
                                     have lattice vector restrictions: \n\

                - alpha,beta,gamma : Angles between lattice vectors. Note, there may not be a need  \n\
                                     to specify all angles, since higher symmetry prototypes \n\
                                     have lattice vector restrictions: \n\

 \n\
                - x1,y1,z1,x2,... :  Coordinates of Wyckoff positions, which have a degree of  \n\
                                     variability. Caution: Order these parameters with care.  \n\
                                     The order of the Wyckoff positions is found in the paper. \n\
                \n\

              rhombohedral (RHL) or hexagonal (HEX).   \n\
	        - RHL cell: a=b=c and alpha=beta=gamma (better for ab-initio, smaller than HEX) \n\
	        - HEX cell: a=b and gamma=120 (this cell is 3 times larger than the RHL) \n\
              The default representation is RHL. To show the prototype in the HEX representation,  \n\
              we add the --hex flag.  \n\
              NOTE: Only applicable for rhombohedral systems.     \n\
   \n\
  [--vasp|--aims|--qe|--abinit|--wyccar]: The structure can be represented in a variety of ab-initio formats, \n\
                                          e.g., VASP, FHI-AIMS, Quantum Espresso, ABINIT, and WYCKAR. \n\
                                          The POSCAR (VASP) format is the default.  \n\
	 \n\
  [--add_equations|--equations_only]:     The symbolic math representations (i.e., equations) of the prototype  \n\
				          can also be printed.   \n\
 \n\
                                            - [--add_equations]  : appends the symbolic math representation to the output \n\
 \n\
                                            - [--equations_only] : only prints the symbolic math represention; does not require \n\
                                                                   parameters to be specified (i.e., can neglect --params=...) \n\
 \n\
                                          Currently, the symbolic math representation is only supported for the VASP and AIMS formats.  \n\
                                          Other formats will be implemented in the future.  \n\

AFLOW-XtalMatch (COMPARE STRUCTURE) README \n\
 \n\
README written by: David Hicks (david.hicks@duke.edu) \n\
 \n\
Citation info: D. Hicks, C. Toher, D.C. Ford, F. Rose,  \n\
               C. De Santo O. Levy, M.J. Mehl, and S. Curtarolo,  \n\
               AFLOW-XtalMatch: Automated method for quantifying the  \n\
               structural similarity of materials and identifying unique  \n\
               crystal prototypes, in preparation (2019). \n\
 \n\
******************************************************************************** \n\
GENERAL OVERVIEW \n\
 \n\
AFLOW-XtalMatch compares crystal structures, regardless of their representation, and  \n\
quantifies their similarity based on criteria specified by H. Burzlaff (Acta Cryst., A53, 217-224 (1997)). \n\
 \n\
The AFLOW-XtalMatch similarity metrics and functionalities are briefly described below.  \n\
 \n\
---------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\
MISFIT CRITERIA \n\
The code returns a misfit (i.e., mismatch) value between the two structures.   \n\
Particular ranges of the misfit are adopted from Burzlaff's work, characterizing structural similarity: \n\
  - misfit <= 0.1       : structures are similar/compatible \n\
  - 0.1 < misfit <= 0.2 : structures are within the same family \n\
  - misfit > 0.2        : structures are not compatible/no match found \n\
 \n\
---------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\
COMPARISON MODES \n\
The module offers four comparison modes: \n\
 \n\
  1) material-type   : maps same element types onto one another, revealing duplicate compounds \n\
  2) structure-type  : maps structures regardless of the element types, identifying crystallographic prototypes \n\
  3) decoration-type : creates and compares all possible atom decorations for a given structure, determining unique and equivalent decorations \n\
  4) magnetic-type   : maps compounds by element types and magnetic moments, distinguishing distinct spin configurations \n\
 \n\
---------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\
MULTIPLE COMPARISONS \n\
AFLOW-XtalMatch can automatically compare multiple compounds in a single command.   \n\
Structures are automatically grouped into comparison sets by stoichiometry,  \n\
species (if applicable), symmetry (space group number and Wyckoff positions), and atomic environment.  \n\
Compounds are compared until each structure is matched or all possible comparisons have been exhausted. \n\
 \n\
See AFLOW COMMANDS USAGE for more details. \n\
 \n\
---------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\
COMPARE TO ESTABLISHED STRUCTURES  \n\
Users can compare input structures to the AFLOW.org repository and the AFLOW Library of Crystallographic Prototypes. \n\
The functionality is useful for identifying equivalent compounds within repositories and relating their properties.  \n\
 \n\
---------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\
PROTOTYPING TOOLS \n\
Structures are automatically cast into the AFLOW standard representation  \n\
consistent with the AFLOW Library of Crystallographic Prototypes.   \n\
The routine determines the internal degrees of freedom for the prototype,  \n\
e.g., esseneite: \n\
 \n\
AFLOW label   : ABC6D2_mC40_15_e_e_3f_f \n\
params        : a,b/a,c/a,beta,y1,y2,x3,y3,z3,x4,y4,z4,x5,y5,z5,x6,y6,z6 \n\
params values : 4.3814,0.901127,0.548523,105.81,0.6918,0.0942,0.1112,0.9123,0.1341,0.3635,0.7411,0.3201,0.3532,0.9802,0.9876,0.2883,0.9057,0.2236 \n\
 \n\
---------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\
MULTITHREADED CAPABILITIES \n\
Many of the AFLOW-XtalMatch functions are parallelized: symmetry analysis, environment analysis, and comparisons. \n\
Use the --np=<number> flag to specify the number of threads for multithreaded comparisons. \n\
 \n\
**************************************************************************************************** \n\
LIST OF AFLOW-XtalMatch COMMANDS: \n\
   \n\
  aflow --compare2database        : Returns AFLOW database entries that match with the structure  \n\
  aflow --compare2prototypes      : Returns AFLOW prototypes that match with the structure \n\

                                    returns their level of similarity \n\
  aflow --compare_structures      : Compares structures (ignore species in mapping) and returns their level  \n\

******************************************************************************** \n\
NOTE ON STRUCTURE SIZE VS SPEED \n\
 \n\
The number of atoms in the system generally increases the computational expense  \n\
of the comparisons.  Namely, it is dependent on the least frequently occurring  \n\
atom (LFA) in the crystal. If LFA>20 or there are many LFAs, then the comparison   \n\
time will increase. In general, the algorithm terminates as soon as a match is found  \n\
(unless you request the optimal match via the --optimize_match option).   \n\
However, this does not improve the speed of the comparison when a match cannot be found,  \n\
since we must explore the entire search space. \n\
 \n\
WAYS TO ENHANCE COMPUTATION SPEED: \n\
  1) Increase the number of processors (--np=xx) \n\
  2) Convert structures to a primitive representation \n\
 \n\
 \n\
******************************************************************************** \n\
OVERVIEW OF COMPARISON ALGORITHM \n\
 \n\
Steps: \n\
    1) Input two structures: structure1 and structure2 \n\
    2) Scale volumes of two structures to be commensurate \n\
    3) Determine the least frequently occurring atom (LFA) \n\
    4) Shift LFA for both structures to their respective origins;  \n\
       these will be used to indicate our lattice \n\
    5) Create a supercell grid of structure2 \n\
    6) Search for all possible lattices in the  \n\
       supercell and see if we can match it with structure1  \n\
       using Burzlaff's criteria. (This part is parallel if more than one \n\
       processor is specified.) \n\
    7) Once a commensurate lattice is found (i.e., similar lattice vector lengths  \n\
       and volume to structure1), remove atoms outside of the cell and  \n\
       check atom positions inside the new cell.  \n\
       Check we can have a one-to-one mapping.  \n\
       Check that the lattice chosen preserves periodicity. \n\
    8) Of the best match (smallest misfit (mis)): \n\
       If mis <= 0.1: \n\
         Structures similar. Print out new representation of  \n\
         structure2 and the figure of misfit \n\
       else if 0.1 < mis <=0.2:   \n\
         Structures in the same family (possible symmetric \n\
         group-subgroup relation). Print out new representation  \n\
         of structure2 and the figure of misfit \n\
       else mis>0.2: \n\
         Structures are not the same. \n\
 \n\
 \n\
******************************************************************************** \n\
OVERVIEW OF MULTIPLE COMPARISON SCHEME \n\
 \n\
Steps: \n\
    1) Read in all files in file list, directory, or structures concatenated into a file. \n\
    2) Obtain stoichiometry/species/space group. \n\
    3) Compare structures that have same stoichiometry, species (if applicable), space group, and  \n\
       LFA environment by picking a representative structure and comparing it with the other structures. \n\
    4) If any of the structures did not match the representative, create another group of  \n\
       comparisons for the ones that did not match. Continue until all structures are  \n\
       matched or until all comparisons are exhausted. \n\
    5) Print out results in both a JSON file (for easy integration into a Python workflow) and text file. \n\
 \n\

        Converts a structure (file) into its corresponding standard AFLOW prototype label.  \n\
        The parameter variables (degrees of freedom) and parameter values are also listed. \n\
        Information about the label and parameters are described in the AFLOW Library of Crystallographic Prototypes: \n\
        Part 1 (doi=10.1016/j.commatsci.2017.01.017),  \n\
        Part 2 (doi=10.1016/j.commatsci.2018.10.043),  \n\

 \n\
            [--setting=1|2|anrl] : Specify the space group setting for the conventional cell/Wyckoff positions.   \n\
              The `anrl' setting follows the choices of the AFLOW Library of Crystallographic Prototypes:  \n\
                  - axis-b for monoclinic space groups,  \n\
                  - rhombohedral setting for rhombohedral space groups, and  \n\
                  - origin centered on the inversion for centrosymmetric space groups  \n\

 \n\
 \n\
    aflow --unique_atom_decorations [GENERAL_COMPARISON_OPTIONS] < file \n\
        Determines the unique and duplicate atom decorations for a given structure, grouping  \n\
        equivalent decorations (if applicable). \n\
 \n\

    [GENERAL_COMPARISON_OPTIONS] : Generic options for all commands (unless indicated otherwise): \n\
 \n\
        [--np=16|--num_proc=16] : Allocate the number of processors/threads for the task. \n\
        [--optimize_match] : Explore all lattice and origin choices to find the best matching representation, i.e., minimizes misfit value. \n\
        [--no_scale_volume] : Suppresses volume rescaling during structure matching; identifies differences due to volume expansion or compression of a structure. \n\
        [--ignore_symmetry] : Neglects symmetry analysis (both space group and Wyckoff positions) for grouping comparisons. \n\
        [--ignore_Wyckoff] : Neglects Wyckoff symmetry (site symmetry) for filtering comparisons, but considers the space group number. \n\
        [--ignore_environment] : Neglects LFA environment analysis for filtering comparisons. \n\
        [--keep_unmatched!] : Retains misfit information of unmatched structures (i.e., misfit>0.1). \n\
        [--match_to_aflow_prototypes!] : Identifies matching AFLOW prototypes to the representative structure.  The option does not apply to  \n\
          --unique_atom_decorations or --compare2prototypes (redundant). \n\
        [--magmom=<m1,m2,...|INCAR|OUTCAR>:...] : Specifies the magnetic moment for each structure (collinear or non-collinear) delimited by colons,  \n\
          signaling a magnetic-type comparison. The option does not apply to --compare_structures since the atom type is neglected. \n\
          AFLOW-XtalMatch supports three input formats for the magnetic moment:  \n\
              1) explicit declaration via comma-separated string m_{1},m_{2},...m_{n} (m_{1,x},m_{1,y},m_{1,z},m_{2,x},...m_{n,z} for non-collinear)  \n\
              2) read from a VASP INCAR, or \n\
              3) read from a VASP OUTCAR. \n\
            Additional magnetic moment readers for other ab initio codes will be available in future versions. \n\
        [--add_aflow_prototype_designation] : Casts prototype structure into the AFLOW standard designation.  The option does not apply to commands  \n\
          --unique_atom_decorations or --prototype! (redundant). \n\
        [--remove_duplicate_compounds] : For structure-type comparisons, duplicate compounds are identified first  \n\
          (via a material-type comparison without volume scaling), then remaining unique compounds are compared, removing duplicate bias. \n\
        [--ICSD] : Only if ICSD structures: ensure the representative structure is the entry with the smallest ICSD number  \n\
        [--print] : For comparing two structures, additional comparison information is printed, including atom mappings, distances between matched atoms,  \n\
          and the transformed structures in the closest matching representation. \n\
        [--print=TEXT|JSON] : For comparing multiple structures, the results printed to the relevant files are formatted into human-readable  \n\
          text or JSON, respectively.  By default, AFLOW-XtalMatch writes the output in both formats. \n\
        [--quiet|--q] : Suppresses the log information for the comparisons. \n\
        [--screen_only] : Prints the comparison results to the screen and does not write to any files. \n\

OVERVIEW \n\
 \n\
This algorithm computes the spectrum of glass-forming ability (GFA) for an alloy \n\
system based on the enthalpy and structural similarity of crystalline phases.  \n\
 \n\
Structures and formation enthalpies are loaded from the AFLOW repository. \n\
 \n\
Local atomic environments are calculated for each unique atom in each structure, \n\
and the similarity between two structures is characterized by the number of \n\
atomic environments that they have in common.  Local variations in the composition \n\
of an alloy system are captured by taking linear combinations of pairs (binary \n\
systems) or triplets (ternary systems) of structures at stoichiometries other than \n\
the global stoichiometry, while requiring that the local stoichiometries balance \n\
to the global stoichiometry.  Weights are assigned to each contribution from a \n\
Gaussian distribution based on the distance between the local and global \n\
stoichiometries. \n\
 \n\
The structures and enthalpies of metastable states (anything with a formation \n\
enthalpy above the convex hull) are compared to those of the ground state \n\
(defined by the convex hull).  The structures of metastable states are also \n\
compared to each other. A Boltzmann factor is used to determine the enthalpy \n\
proximity between a metastable state and the ground state. \n\
 \n\
Finally, the GFA is calculated over a grid of stoichiometries as the multiplication \n\
of the functions describing the structural similarity and enthalpy similarity  \n\
normalized by the sum of the weights. \n\
 \n\
AFLOW_CHULL is used to calculate the convex hull and AFLOW_COMPARE is used to \n\
remove duplicate structures from the analysis. \n\
 \n\
******************************************************************************** \n\
 \n\
USAGE: \n\
  aflow --gfa --alloy=XX --ae_file=YY --cutoff_energy=ZZ > output.out \n\
 \n\
    XX is the case sensitive alloy system (e.g. CaCu). \n\
 \n\
    YY is the name of a file containing the atomic environments for the \n\
	  system (e.g. All_atomic_environments_read.dat).  The name must not be \n\
	  All_atomic_environments.dat.  The code will calculate the atomic \n\
	  environments if no file is specified. \n\
 \n\
    ZZ is the formation enthalpy per atom in eV to use as a cutoff for \n\
    including structures in the analysis.  Set this based on the \n\
    expected glass transition temperature of the system.  The default is \n\
    0.05 eV ~ 580 K. \n\
 \n\
  It is suggested to direct the standard out to a file (e.g. output.out) \n\
	because it contains useful information about the calculation that \n\
	you may want to keep.   \n\
            \n\
******************************************************************************** \n\
 \n\
OUTPUT: \n\
  standard out - contains information about the calculation, such as which \n\
    atomic environments were read/calculated and the GFA calculation at each \n\
	  stoichiometry (weights, number of combinations (pseudostructures), etc.) \n\
	    \n\
  GFA_entries.dat - contains the stoichiometries and formation enthalpies \n\
	  of the structures used in the GFA calculation. \n\
 \n\
  GFA_xx.dat - contains the GFA at each stoichiometry on the grid for the \n\
	  alloy system. \n\
 \n\
  All_atomic_environments.dat - contains the atomic environments for each \n\
	  species in each structure used in the GFA calculation. The format is: \n\
 \n\
    AUID = aaaa   atom = species \n\
	  # atoms  # environments \n\
	  # types of vertices in each environment (one entry for each environment) \n\
	  # occurrences of each environment (one entry for each environment) \n\

GENERAL OVERVIEW \n\
 \n\
AFLOW-SYM is a robust symmetry analysis tool catered to - but not limited to -  \n\
high-throughput frameworks.  With built-in self-consistency symmetry validation and  \n\
an adaptive tolerance scheme, AFLOW-SYM resolves a globally consistent symmetry  \n\
profile. \n\
 \n\
The AFLOW-SYM functions fully characterize the symmetry of a crystal, including  \n\
the space group, lattice types, Pearson symbol, Wyckoff positions, point group,  \n\
factor group, symmetrically equivalent atoms, etc.  The AFLOW-SYM commands, along  \n\
with important usage information, are listed below. \n\

**************************************************************************************************** \n\
SUPPORTED GEOMETRY FILE FORMATS: \n\
 \n\
AFLOW-SYM reads the following geometry file types: \n\
 \n\
  - Crystallographic Input File (CIF) \n\
  - VASP (POSCAR) \n\
  - QuantumESPRESSO \n\
  - ABINIT \n\
  - FHI-AIMS \n\
 \n\
More file types will be added in later versions. \n\
 \n\
 \n\
**************************************************************************************************** \n\
SELF-CONSISTENT SYMMETRY: \n\
 \n\
AFLOW-SYM includes self-consistency symmetry checks to identify a globally  \n\
commensurate symmetry description. \n\
 \n\
The following commands provide the most extensive self-consistency checks and are  \n\
recommended for finding the symmetry of a material: \n\
 \n\
  aflow --aflow-sym : Validates symmetry operations between point groups, factor group,  \n\
                      space group, site symmetry, and equivalent/unique atoms  \n\
  aflow --edata     : Validates symmetry between the space group, lattice types, Pearson  \n\
                      symbol, etc. \n\
 \n\
The remaining commands are performed independently and are not validated with the full symmetry  \n\
profile. \n\
 \n\
 \n\
**************************************************************************************************** \n\
TOLERANCE: \n\
 \n\
AFLOW-SYM offers an adaptive tolerance scheme to combat issues arising from  \n\
numerical instabilities.  If any of the symmetry analyses yield incommensurate  \n\
symmetry, a radial tolerance scan is performed around the inital input tolerance.  \n\
All symmetry properties are then recalculated from the new tolerance. \n\
 \n\
The initial tolerance can be specified by appending it to the command with an \"=\". \n\
 \n\
  Ex: aflow --aflow-sym=<tolerance> \n\
 \n\
  Preset AFLOW tolerances: \n\
    tight : minimum_interatomic_distance/100.0 (default) \n\
    loose : minimum_interatomic_distance/10.0 \n\
 \n\
    Ex: aflow --aflow-sym=tight  OR  aflow --aflow-sym=loose \n\
 \n\
  User defined tolerances: \n\
    Any value between 1e-10 and the minimum interatomic distance \n\
     \n\
    Ex: aflow --aflow-sym=1e-2 \n\
 \n\
No tolerance scan option: \n\
  The tolerance scan functionality can be suppresed by appending the option flag  \n\
  [--no_scan] to the command. \n\
 \n\
 \n\
**************************************************************************************************** \n\
MAGNETIC ANALYSIS: \n\
 \n\
The symmetry of magnetic systems is calculated by adding the magnetic moment  \n\
information (symmetry of lattice, atoms, and spin). Works for both collinear  \n\
and non-collinear spin. \n\
 \n\
The magnetic symmetry analysis is performed by specifying the magnetic moment(s) \n\
via the optional [--magmom] flag. \n\
  \n\
Magnetic moment input formats: \n\
   1) Explicitly via comma separated magnetic moments (m1, m2, ..., mn) in the same  \n\
      order as the input file \n\
        - Ex: aflow --aflow-sym --magmom=1.0,-1.0,1.0 \n\
   2) Read from the VASP INCAR by specifying path to file \n\
        - Ex: aflow --aflow-sym --magmom=path_to_incar \n\
   3) Read from the VASP OUTCAR by specifying path to file \n\
        - Ex: aflow --aflow-sym --magmom=path_to_outcar \n\
   4) Magnetic moment readers for other ab-initio codes will be added in later versions. \n\
 \n\
   AFLOW autodetects collinear or non-collinear based on the input. \n\
 \n\
Relevant for the following commands: \n\
 \n\
  aflow --aflow-sym \n\
  aflow --aflowSG \n\
  aflow --edata \n\
  aflow --equivalent \n\
  aflow --factorgroup \n\
  aflow --pointgroup_crystal \n\
  aflow --pointgroupkcrystal    \n\
  aflow --sgdata               \n\
  aflow --sitepointgroup      \n\
  aflow --spacegroup         \n\
  aflow --wyccar            \n\
 \n\
NOTE: This analysis does not account for time reversal symmetry (spin flips), which is  \n\
      necessary to find the magnetic space group.  The magnetic symmetry analysis  \n\
      here considers the symmetry-breaking feature of the spin-degree of freedom in  \n\
      magnetic systems. \n\
      The magnetic space groups will be added in a later version. \n\
 \n\
**************************************************************************************************** \n\
CELL/SETTING CHOICES: \n\
 \n\
Upon performing the symmetry analysis, AFLOW-SYM can represent the structure with respect to  \n\
common cell/setting choices listed in the ITC with the option flag [--setting=1 | =2]. \n\
Different cell/setting choice exist for: \n\
  - centrosymmetric space groups with two origin choices (24 space groups, e.g., sg=227):  \n\
      --setting=1 : origin centered on high site symmetry (not inversion site) \n\
      --setting=2 : origin centered on inversion site \n\
  - rhombohedral space groups (e.g., space group 166):  \n\
      --setting=1 : rhombohedral setting  \n\
      --setting=2 : hexagonal setting \n\
  - monoclinic space groups (e.g., space group 5):  \n\
      --setting=1 : unique axis-b  \n\
      --setting=2 : unique axis-c \n\
 \n\
More information on these setting choices is located in ITC Vol. A on pg. 17 (5th Edition). \n\
 \n\
Relevant for the following commands (i.e., when the conventional cell/Wyckoff positions is shown): \n\
  aflow --cif \n\
  aflow --edata \n\
  aflow --sgdata \n\
  aflow --wyccar \n\
 \n\
 \n\
**************************************************************************************************** \n\
OUTPUT FORMAT: \n\
 \n\
AFLOW-SYM contains functionality to print the results in a standard text output  \n\
and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). \n\
 \n\
The output format can be specified by appending the optional flag [--print=<format>]. \n\
 \n\
  Text output (default): \n\
    Ex: aflow --edata --print=txt \n\
 \n\
  JSON output:  \n\
    Ex: aflow --edata --print=json  \n\

AFLOW COMMANDS USAGE: \n\
   \n\
  aflow --aflow-sym|--AFLOW-SYM|--AFLOWSYM|--aflowSYM|--aflowsym|--full_symmetry|--full_sym|--fullsym[=tolerance| =tight| =loose] [--no_scan] [--print=txt | --print=json] [--screen_only] [--mag|--magnetic|--magmom=[m1,m2,...|INCAR|OUTCAR]] < POSCAR \n\
        Calculates the full symmetry of a crystal: point group lattice, point group crystal, factor group, \n\
        space group, site point group, inequivalent/equivalent atoms, and the point group of the klattice. \n\
        This routine calculates the full symmetry suite at a certain tolerance. If symmetry rules are broken, \n\
        the code automatically changes tolerance and recalculates from the beginning. \n\
        Tolerance: \n\
           The tolerance is given in Angstroms.  There are two preset tolerances: \n\
             tight: minimum_interatomic_distance/100.0 \n\
             loose: minimum_interatomic_distance/10.0 \n\
           The default tolerance is the \"tight\" tolerance value. \n\
           A value can also be specified. (Note, it must not be below the minimum  \n\
           interatomic distance, otherwise an error will be thrown.) \n\
        Magnetic analysis: \n\
          The magnetic tag specifies the magnetic moment on each of the atoms.  The \n\
          two input formats are a comma separated string of the magnetic moments - \n\
          in the same order as the input file, the location of the INCAR, or the location \n\
          of the OUTCAR, which is then read and the magnetic moment for each atom is found \n\
          (must be a static calculation, otherwise this information isn't specified). \n\
          Works for both collinear and non-collinear systems (AFLOW autodetects \n\
          collinear/non-collinear based on the input). \n\
        Options: \n\
          [--no_scan] : Will not perform tolerance scan. \n\
          [--print=txt | --print=json] : Specify output format. \n\
          [--screen_only] : Prints symmetry elements to string and does not write to a file. \n\
          [--mag|--magnetic|--magmom=[m1,m2,...|INCAR|OUTCAR]]: Perform symmetry analysis of spin system, where spin degree of freedom breaks symmetry  \n\
 \n\
  aflow --aflowSG[_label,_number][=tolerance | =tight | =loose] [--no_scan] [--mag|--magnetic|--magmom=[m1,m2,...|INCAR|OUTCAR]] < POSCAR \n\
        Calculates the space group of the crystal in the ITC convention. \n\
        No assumptions are made on the input POSCAR-- may be supercell, primitive, etc. \n\
        Gives the Bravais lattice, crystal system, point group, space group number and wyckoff set. \n\
        The origin choice is always the first choice in ITC 5th edition. This is the highest symmetry \n\
        choice. (However, for Monoclinic systems, different unique axes and cell choices are examined to \n\
        ensure a spacegroup is identified.) This routine consists of an adaptive tolerance; if any symmetry  \n\
        rules are broken, the tolerance is changed and everything is recalculated. \n\
        Tolerance: \n\
           The tolerance is given in Angstroms.  There are two preset tolerances: \n\
             tight: minimum_interatomic_distance/100.0 \n\
             loose: minimum_interatomic_distance/10.0 \n\
           The default tolerance is the \"tight\" tolerance value. \n\
           A value can also be specified. (Note, it must be below the minimum  \n\
           interatomic distance, otherwise an error will be thrown.) \n\
        Can be called inside aflow via: \n\
              xstructure.SpaceGroup_ITC()        (default tolerance) \n\
              xstructure.SpaceGroup_ITC(tol)     (user defined tolerance) \n\
        AFLOW counterpart to platonSG and findsymSG. \n\
        Magnetic analysis: \n\
          The magnetic tag specifies the magnetic moment on each of the atoms.  The \n\
          two input formats are a comma separated string of the magnetic moments - \n\
          in the same order as the input file, the location of the INCAR, or the location  \n\
          of the OUTCAR, which is then read and the magnetic moment for each atom is found  \n\
          (must be a static calculation, otherwise this information isn't specified). \n\
          Works for both collinear and non-collinear systems (AFLOW autodetects  \n\
          collinear/non-collinear based on the input). \n\
        Options: \n\
          [--no_scan] : Will not perform tolerance scan. \n\
          [--mag|--magnetic|--magmom=[m1,m2,...|INCAR|OUTCAR]]: Perform symmetry analysis of spin system, where spin degree of freedom breaks symmetry  \n\
   \n\
  aflow --cif[=tolerance | =tight | =loose] [--setting=1| =2] [--no_symmetry] < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard out a Crystallographic Information File \n\
        (cif) format file based on the POSCAR input file. \n\
        This can be used as input for Mercury, and is the preferred \n\
        format in Gerd's structure collection. \n\
        Tolerance: \n\
           The tolerance is given in Angstroms.  There are two preset tolerances: \n\
             tight: minimum_interatomic_distance/100.0 \n\
             loose: minimum_interatomic_distance/10.0 \n\
           The default tolerance is the \"tight\" tolerance value. \n\
           A value can also be specified. (Note, it must not be below the minimum \n\
           interatomic distance, otherwise an error will be thrown.) \n\
        Space group setting: \n\
          The space group setting can be specified with the optional flag [--setting=1| =2] (the default is setting 1). \n\
          For rhombohedral systems, setting 1=rhl and 2=hex. \n\
          For monoclinic systems, setting 1=unique axis-b and 2=unique axis-c. \n\
        Options: \n\
          [--no_symmetry] : Will not perform symmetry analysis and return the CIF with space group 1. \n\
  \n\
  aflow --edata[=tolerance| =tight| =loose] [--setting=1| =2] [--no_scan] [--print=txt | --print=json] < POSCAR \n\
        Outputs to standard the information given by --data in addition \n\
        to lattice-, superlattice- and reciprocal-lattice types. \n\
        This routine consists of symmetry consistency checks. If symmetry rules are broken, \n\
        the code automatically changes tolerance and recalculates from the beginning. \n\
        Tolerance: \n\
           The tolerance is given in Angstroms.  There are two preset tolerances: \n\
             tight: minimum_interatomic_distance/100.0 \n\

           The default tolerance is the \"tight\" tolerance value. \n\
           A value can also be specified. (Note, it must not be below the minimum \n\

 \n\
  aflow --wyccar[=tolerance | =tight | =loose] [--no_scan] [--setting=1| =2] [--mag|--magnetic|--magmom=[m1,m2,...|INCAR|OUTCAR]] < POSCAR \n\
        Prints the wyccar file (the poscar file with wyckoff positions) for the input POSCAR \n\
        The wyccar format presents the lattice in standard conventional form and the wyckoff \n\
        positions with their associated labels and site symmetry. If variability in the \n\
        Wyckoff positions exists, the algorithm finds the Wykoff positions with the \"smallest\" \n\
        lettering scheme (\"a\" being the smallest). (R. Taylor/ D. Hicks) \n\
        Tolerance: \n\
           The tolerance is given in Angstroms.  There are two preset tolerances: \n\
             tight: minimum_interatomic_distance/100.0 \n\
             loose: minimum_interatomic_distance/10.0 \n\
           The default tolerance is the \"tight\" tolerance value. \n\
           A value can also be specified. (Note, it must not be below the minimum \n\
           interatomic distance, otherwise an error will be thrown.) \n\
        Space group setting: \n\
          The space group setting can be specified with the optional flag [--setting=1| =2] (the default is setting 1). \n\
          For rhombohedral systems, setting 1=rhl and 2=hex. \n\
          For monoclinic systems, setting 1=unique axis-b and 2=unique axis-c. \n\
        Magnetic analysis: \n\
          The magnetic tag specifies the magnetic moment on each of the atoms.  The \n\
          two input formats are a comma separated string of the magnetic moments - \n\
          in the same order as the input file, the location of the INCAR, or the location \n\
          of the OUTCAR, which is then read and the magnetic moment for each atom is found \n\
          (must be a static calculation, otherwise this information isn't specified). \n\
          Works for both collinear and non-collinear systems (AFLOW autodetects \n\
          collinear/non-collinear based on the input). \n\
        Options: \n\
          [--no_scan] : Will not perform tolerance scan. \n\
          [--mag|--magnetic|--magmom=[m1,m2,...|INCAR|OUTCAR]]: Perform symmetry analysis of spin system, where spin degree of freedom breaks symmetry \n\

USER INSTRUCTIONS: \n\
 \n\
(i) GENERAL INFORMATION: \n\
Implementation to obtain corrected DFT formation enthalpies based on the coordination corrected  \n\
enthalpies (CCE) methodology described in: \n\
Friedrich et al., Coordination corrected ab initio formation enthalpies, npj Comput. Mater. 5, 59 (2019); \n\
Please cite this article when using this method and/or this implementation. \n\
The corrections depend on the number of cation-anion bonds and on the cation oxidation state. \n\
The current implementation requires a structure file in VASP5 POSCAR format as input and will  \n\
return the CCE corrections for the DFT formation energies for PBE, LDA and SCAN if the oxidation  \n\
numbers can be determined. \n\
The oxidation numbers can be determined in two ways: \n\
- automatically based on the structure and Allen electronegativities (if no oxidation numbers \n\
are given as input) or \n\
- as specified by the user as an input option \n\
In addition, the user can provide precalculated DFT formation energies for PBE, LDA and SCAN and the  \n\
implementation will directly calculate and return the CCE formation enthalpies at both 298.15 and 0K. \n\
If DFT formation energies are provided as additional input, the functionals corresponding to those  \n\
energies are required. They need to be given in the same sequence as the precalculated DFT formation  \n\
energies they correspond to. \n\
However, when you specify only one formation energy, no functional is required as it is assumed to  \n\
be PBE (default). \n\
Details for the options available are explained in the following. \n\
 \n\
(ii) AVAILABLE OPTIONS: \n\
--cce                       Prints these user instructions. \n\
--cce=POSCAR_FILE_PATH      Provide the path to the structure file in VASP5 POSCAR format. \n\
--dft_formation_energies=   Provide a comma separated list of precalculated DFT formation energies,  \n\
                            they are assumed to be: (i) negative for compounds lower in energy  \n\
                            than the elements, (ii) in eV/cell. Currently, corrections are available  \n\
                            for PBE, LDA and SCAN. \n\
--functionals=              Provide a comma separated list of functionals for which corrections  \n\
                            should be returned. If used together with --dft_formation energies,  \n\
                            the functionals must be in the same sequence as the DFT formation  \n\
                            energies they correspond to. Available functionals are:  \n\
                            (i) PBE, (ii) LDA or (iii) SCAN. Default: PBE (if only one DFT formation  \n\
                            energy is provided). \n\
--oxidation_numbers=        Provide as a comma separated list the oxidation numbers. It is  \n\
                            assumed that: (i) one is provided for each atom of the structure and  \n\
                            (ii) they are in the same sequence as the corresponding atoms in the  \n\
                            provided POSCAR file. \n\
 \n\
(iii) EXAMPLE INPUT STRUCTURE FOR ROCKSALT MgO: \n\

 \n\
(iv) EXAMPLE COMMANDS: \n\
Assuming that AFLOW is in your PATH and you saved the above example structure file for MgO  \n\
in the current directory as POSCAR, the following commands can be executed: \n\
 \n\
aflow --cce=POSCAR --dft_formation_energies=-5.434,-6.220,-6.249 --functionals=PBE,LDA,SCAN \n\
This will give you the CCE corrections and CCE formation enthalpies for PBE, LDA, and SCAN for MgO. \n\
 \n\
aflow --cce=POSCAR --dft_formation_energies=-6.220 --functionals=LDA \n\
This gives you only the CCE corrections and CCE formation enthalpies for LDA. \n\
 \n\
aflow --cce=POSCAR --dft_formation_energies=-5.434 \n\
This gives you the CCE corrections and CCE formation enthalpies for PBE with a warning that  \n\
PBE is assumed as functional. \n\
 \n\
aflow --cce=POSCAR \n\
This gives you the CCE corrections for PBE, LDA, and SCAN and a rough guess of the formation  \n\
enthalpy based on experimental formation enthalpies per bond. \n\
 \n\
aflow --cce=POSCAR --oxidation_numbers=2,-2 \n\
Oxidation numbers for each atom can also be provided as input. \n\

GENERAL OVERVIEW \n\
 \n\
AFLOW-CHULL is an automated thermodynamic stability analysis tool. Compound data is downloaded from the \n\
AFLOW REST-API/AFLUX Search-API and the minimum energy surface is calculated using a modified \n\
variant (dimensionally-iterative) of the qhull convex hull algorithm: \n\
ACM Trans. on Mathematical Software, 22(4):469-483, Dec 1996. \n\
Various thermodynamic properties are extracted, including off-hull (full decomposition reaction,  \n\
distances to the hull) and on-hull (equilibrium phases, equivalent ground state structures) features. \n\
Determination of the stability criterion is also available, which has served as a powerful \n\
screening tool for the discovery of new permanent magnets: Science Adv. 3(4), e1602241 (2017). \n\
 \n\
Other important analyses running under the hood include: \n\
 - structure comparison analysis via Burzlaff criteria (--readme=compare) \n\
 - outlier detection and removal (interquartile range). \n\
 \n\
Various output formats are provided, including plain text, json, PDF, and Jupyter. \n\
 \n\
**************************************************************************************************** \n\
LIST OF AFLOW-CHULL COMMANDS: \n\
   \n\
  aflow --convex_hull=|--chull --alloy=MnPdPt[,AlCuZn,...] [chull_options] [--destination=[DIRECTORY]] \n\
      Queries the AFLOW API for relevant entries (see --load_library), calculates \n\
      the convex hull, and returns the information as a PDF (default, see --output). \n\
      --chull : Necessary flag for entering mode for calculating convex hull. \n\
      --alloy : Necessary argument, specifies system. This code is not dimension specific,  \n\
          i.e., you can calculate the convex hull for any n-ary system. \n\
          There are two input modes:  raw (comma-separated) and combinatorial (colon- and comma-separated). \n\
          Raw input:  --alloy=MnPdPt,AlCuZn. \n\
          Combinatorial input:  --alloy=Ag,Au:Mn.  This is interpreted as --alloy=AgMn,AuMn. \n\
      [--destination=[DIRECTORY]] : Optional argument, specify the directory for the output.   \n\
          Default is \"./\". \n\
      [--usage] : Returns usage commands and options. \n\
      [--print=|--p=|--output=|--o=latex|pdf|json|text|jupyter|jupyter2|jupyter3] : Select the output format. Latex/PDF are the same (.pdf). \n\
          JSON and plain text have the following extensions:  .json and .txt. \n\
          jupyter|jupyter2|jupyter3 creates a jupter notebook json file that plots a convex hull for the specified alloy (jupyter3 is default). \n\
          Default is Latex/PDF. \n\
      [--screen_only] : Output is direct to screen (stdout) instead of writing to a file.  \n\
          All logging output is surpressed. \n\
      [--keep=log|--keep_log|--keeplog|--log] : Prints a log file of relevant output. \n\
      [--keep=tex,log] : Keep both. \n\
       \n\
      LOADING OPTIONS: \n\
      [--load_library=|--loadlibrary=|--ll=icsd|lib1|lib2|lib3] : Specify libraries \n\
          from which to load.  Default:  icsd, lib2, and lib3. \n\
      [--load_API|--load_api|--loadapi|--lapi|--api] : Force loading entries from the API (default unless \n\
          on nietzsche, aflowlib, or habana). \n\
      [--load_entries_entry_output|--loadentriesentryoutput|--leo] : Get full output for \n\
          all entries loaded from the AFLOW API. \n\
      [--neglect=|--ban=aflow:bb0d45ab555bc208,aflow:fb9eaa58604ce774] : \n\
          Ban specific entries from the convex hull calculation, done by AUID. \n\
      [--see_neglect|--seeneglect| --sn] : Show why entries were neglected. \n\
      [--remove_extreme_points=|--removeextremepoints=|--remove_extrema=|--removeextrema=|--rep=-1000] : \n\
          Exclude points based on Hf/Ts (floor/ceiling). Units are meV/atom / K. \n\
      [--entropic_temperature|--entropictemperature|--entroptemp] : Calculate the Ts \n\
          convex hull (upper-half). Default is Hf hull (lower-half).   \n\
      [--include_paw_gga|--paw_gga] : Include calculations run with PAW_GGA. Easily coupled \n\
          with default PAW_PBE (same level of theory, differently parametrized). \n\
 \n\
      ANALYSIS OPTIONS: \n\
      [--distance_to_hull=|--distancetohull=|--distance2hull=|--dist2hull=|--d2h=aflow:bb0d45ab555bc208,aflow:fb9eaa58604ce774] : \n\
          Calculates a structure's distance below/above (Hf/Ts) the hull. \n\
      [--stability_criterion=|--stabilitycriterion=|--stable_criterion=|--scriterion=|--sc=aflow:bb0d45ab555bc208,aflow:fb9eaa58604ce774] : \n\
          Calculates the stability criterion of the ground state structure. Will return \n\
          a warning if structure is not a ground state one. It removes the point from the  \n\
          hull, calculates the new hull, and calculates the distance of this point from \n\
          below/above (Hf/Ts) hull. \n\
      [--hull_formation_enthalpy=|--hull_energy=0.25,0.25] : Returns the value of the convex hull surface at the specified coordinate/concentration. \n\
          For stoichiometric hulls, provide the reduced composition form, i.e., for the compound Mn2PdPt, use \n\
          --hull_formation_enthalpy=0.5,0.25, where the composition of the last component is implicitly 1-sum(0.5+0.25). \n\
          Providing an additional component (e.g., --dist2hull=0.5,0.25,0.1) results in a rigid shift in the energy axis and, \n\
          thus, a constant added to the final distance calculated (0.1 is in units of eV for formation energy hulls). \n\
      [--skip_structure_comparison|--skipstructruecomparison|--skipstructcomp|--ssc] : structure comparison analysis for determination of \n\
          equivalent ground state structures is skipped (can be time consuming). \n\
      [--skip_stability_criterion_analysis|--skipstabilitycriterionanalysis|--skipscriterion|--sscriterion] : analysis \n\
          of stability criterion for ground state structures is skipped (can be time consuming). \n\
      [--include_skewed_hulls|--include_skewed|--ish] : process hull despite skewed endpoints (abs(ground state endpoint energy) < 15 meV). \n\
      [--include_unreliable_hulls|--include_unreliable|--iuh] : process hull despite poor statistics (binary hull count < 200). \n\
      [--include_outliers|--io] : include any detected outliers (output/warning is still shown). \n\
      [--force] : force output despite warnings. \n\
 \n\
      PDF/LATEX OPTIONS: \n\
      [--image_only|--imageonly|--image] : Latex/PDF output mode only. Similar to --document_only,  \n\
          but the image dimensions are not necessarily for a standard page. Preferred option for  \n\
          importing into papers/presentations. \n\
      [--no_document|--nodocument|--no_doc|--nodoc|--full_page_image|--fullpageimage] : \n\
          Latex/PDF output mode only. Generates a PDF of just the convex hull illustration (2/3D). \n\
          Dimensions: 8.5x11 inches (standard page), landscape. \n\
      [--document_only|--documentonly|--doc_only|--doconly|--doc] : Latex/PDF output mode only. \n\
          Exclude convex hull illustration. This is the default for quaternary systems and above. \n\

This document describes exceptions in AFLOW. It is primarily intended for developers, but users may \n\
 find useful information in here as well. \n\
 \n\
Exceptions are thrown after an error in AFLOW occurs. They return a message with the function in \n\
which the error occurred, the kind of error that occurred, and a detailed description of the error. \n\
Exceptions in AFLOW are designed to terminate an AFLOW run and are preferable to hard exits. If an \n\
error should not cause AFLOW to exit, please use warnings instead. \n\
 \n\
AFLOW exceptions are part of AUROSTD and can be accessed by including the aurostd or the \n\
aurostd_exception header file. \n\
 \n\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\
 \n\
1. Using Exceptions in AFLOW \n\
1.1. Message Structure \n\
An exception contains: \n\
 \n\
  - The name of the function that throws the exception (f_name). \n\
  - An error code (error_code). \n\
  - An error type (error_type) with a more detailed error. \n\
  - A message accompanying the exception. \n\
 \n\
The output is structured as follows: \n\
 \n\
\"f_name ERROR error_code: error_type(error) - message\" \n\
 \n\
After printing the message, AFLOW will terminate, using the error code as the exit code. \n\
 \n\
1.2. How to Throw an Exception \n\
To use AFLOW exceptions, the aurostd_exception.h file must be included in the cpp file. The \n\
exception can be thrown using: \n\
 \n\
    throw aurostd::xerror(function, message, error_code); \n\
 \n\
The parameters are: \n\
 \n\
  - function (std::string or std::stringstream): the name of the function from which the exception \n\
        is thrown. \n\
  - message (std::string or std::stringstream): a detailed message about the error that caused the \n\
        exception. \n\
  - error_code (int): the error code (defaults to 1). \n\
 \n\
For more information on error codes, see 1.3, and for more information on which exception to throw, \n\
see 2.2. \n\
 \n\
1.3 Error Types and Error Codes \n\
AFLOW exceptions are assigned to error types, and each type contains more specific errors (see \n\
section 2. for details). The first digit of the error code corresponds to the error type, the second \n\
digit to the error associated with the error type. For example, all errors associated with input in \n\
aflow.in will have error codes between 10 and 19. \n\
 \n\
The following error codes are reserved: \n\
 \n\
  - Error code 0. \n\
  - Error codes without error type. \n\
  - Error codes for generic errors. \n\
 \n\
Error code 0: \n\
  Since the error codes are also used as exit codes, 0 cannot be used for error codes as it implies \n\
  that AFLOW terminated normally. \n\
 \n\
Error codes without error types: \n\
  Error codes without error types refer to general AFLOW errors that cannot be classified with an \n\
  error type. The error codes reserved for these types are 1 - 9. \n\
 \n\
Generic errors: \n\
  Generic errors are errors that can be described using an error type, but cannot be specified with \n\
  a more detailed category and do not warrant the creation of a new error classification. Their \n\
  error codes end with 0. For example, a method requiring a uniform supercell expansion, but \n\
  receiving a structure with a non-uniform expansion would be such a generic runtime error. \n\
 \n\
When using error codes, it is advisable to use the names of the error code constants shown in 2.1. \n\
instead of the numbers themselves. It will make the code more legible and changes much easier to \n\
implement. \n\
 \n\
2. Description of the Exceptions \n\
2.1. List of Exceptions with Error Codes \n\
 \n\
This list can be output by running aflow -e|--errors|--exceptions. \n\

2.2. Detailed Descriptions of the Exceptions \n\
 \n\
[1-9] No error type: Errors that cannot be classified under an error type. \n\
 \n\
   1. Generic error (default): Generic AFLOW error. Throw when nothing else fits. \n\
 \n\
   2. Illegal error code: Thrown when the exception is supplied with an invalid error code. \n\
 \n\
[10 - 19] Input Error: Errors within the user input, e.g. in aflow.in or in command line arguments. \n\
  This error type should only be used for illegal input and not for errors that result from bad \n\
  parameters. \n\
 \n\
  For example, tolerance = 1E-18 is legal input, but some programs may require this value to be \n\
  higher. In that case, a Value Error (out of range) should be raised instead. On the other hand, \n\
  tolerance = dog is illegal input and should thus result in an Input Error (illegal parameter). \n\
 \n\
  11. Unknown flag: Used when aflow.in contains a flag that is not a valid AFLOW input flag. \n\
 \n\
  12. Missing flag: Used when aflow.in is missing a required flag. \n\
 \n\
  13. Input ambiguous: Used when aflow.in contains two contradictory or mutually exclusive entries. \n\
 \n\
  14. Illegal parameter: Used when a flag in aflow.in is supplied with an invalid parameter. For \n\
                         example, a flag that requires a positive number, but is supplied with a \n\
                         negative number or with non-numeric characters, would require this \n\
                         exception to be thrown. \n\
 \n\
  15. Number of parameters: Used when the number of parameters for input flags are inconsistent. \n\
                            For example, when the number of entries in MAGMOM is not the same as \n\
                            the number of atoms in the structure, this exception should be thrown. \n\
 \n\
[20 - 29] File Error: Errors associated with files. \n\
 \n\
  21. File not found: Used when the requested file is not found. \n\
 \n\
  22. Wrong format: Used when the requested file is not in the correct format, e.g. when AFLOW \n\
                    tries to read a text file, but the file is binary. \n\
 \n\
  23. File corrupt: Used when the requested file is incomplete or corrupt, e.g. an incomplete APL \n\
                    hibernation (APL.xml) file. \n\
 \n\
[30 - 39] Value Error: \n\
 \n\
  31. Illegal value: Used when a supplied value is illegal, e.g. a negative number for a parameter \n\
                     that requires positive numbers. This exception should not be thrown when the \n\
                     illegal value is detected while user input is processed. Use Input \n\
                      Error (illegal parameter) instead. \n\
 \n\
  32. Out of range: Used when a supplied value is too high or too low. \n\
 \n\
[40 - 49] Index Error: \n\
 \n\
  41. Illegal value: Used when the value for an index or for the size of an array, vector, etc. is \n\
                     illegal (e.g. a negative number). \n\
 \n\
  42. Out of bounds: Used when an index is larger than the size of an array, vector, etc. \n\
 \n\
  43: Mismatch: Used when two objects have different shapes even though the same shape is required, \n\
                e.g. when adding two xmatrix objects. \n\
 \n\
[50 - 59] Runtime Error: \n\
 \n\
  51. Not initialized: Used when an uninitialized object is used. The increment operator in xcombos \n\
                       may throw such an error. \n\
 \n\
  52. SQL Error: Used when SQLite returns an error. \n\
 \n\
[61 - 69] Allocation Error: Errors associated with memory allocation. \n\
 \n\
  61. Could not allocate: Used when requested memory could not be allocated. \n\
 \n\
  62. Insufficient memory: Used when more memory is requested than available. \n\
 \n\
 \n\
3. Changing and Adding New Exceptions \n\
Two std::string arrays found in aurostd_exception.cpp contain the exception descriptors: \n\
 \n\
  - \"error_types\" contains the error types. \n\
  - \"errors\" contains the errors associated with each error type. \n\
 \n\
To change the name of an existing exception, simply replace the names in these \n\
arrays. \n\
 \n\

*                                                                                                  * \n\
**************************************************************************************************** \n\
 \n\
The more exceptions exist, the more difficult it is to keep track of them. This reduces the \n\
legibility of the code and makes implementing meaningful error messages, and thus debugging, more \n\
difficult. Therefore, before adding a new exception, please double-check that the error cannot be \n\
described with an existing exception. If a new exception needs to be added, it should be as generic \n\
as possible and should be applicable to many different scenarios. \n\
 \n\
To add an error to an existing error type, the following steps are necessary: \n\
 \n\
  - Replace one of the empty strings in the errors array. Make sure that the subarray maps to the \n\
    correct error type. \n\
  - Add a shorthand name for the error code into the definitions at the top of aurostd_exception.h. \n\
  - Update the table in section 2.1. of this README. \n\
  - Update the banner in aflow.cpp. \n\
 \n\
To add a new error type, do the following: \n\
 \n\
  - Add the new error type in the error_types array. \n\
  - Update the _AFLOW_NUM_ERR_TYPES_ at the top of aurostd_exception.cpp. \n\
  - Add a new line with nine (9) empty strings to the errors array.  \n\
  - Update the table in section 2.1. of this README. \n\
  - Update the banner in aflow.cpp. \n\
 \n\

*     It is inadvisable to change the order of the error types and errors. If the order is         * \n\

INSTRUCTIONS: \n\
 \n\
xaflow downloads and installs the newest version of AFLOW automatically. \n\
xaflow needs to be installed first before installing aflow. \n\
N.B. xaflow is a makefile. \n\
 \n\
Installing xaflow (perform only once): \n\
1. Download xaflow: \n\
      wget materials.duke.edu/AFLOW/xaflow \n\
  - Note that this may require you to first install wget on your machine,  \n\
    if it is not all already available. \n\
  - On mac: brew install wget. \n\
  - On linux: sudo apt-get install wget. \n\
2. Move/copy xaflow somewhere in your path: \n\
      mkdir ~/bin \n\
      export PATH=~/bin:$PATH \n\
      mv xaflow ~/bin/xaflow \n\
  - Add the \"export PATH=~/bin:$PATH\" line to your ~/.bashrc so  \n\
    it always stays in your path. \n\
3. Ensure the file can be executed:  \n\
      chmod 555 ~/bin/xaflow \n\
4. Check that xaflow is in your path:  \n\
      which xaflow \n\
  - A returned path means xaflow has been successfully installed. \n\
 \n\
Installing aflow (perform with every new version): \n\
1. Run xaflow: \n\
      xaflow \n\
  - xaflow downloads, unpacks, and makes AFLOW in ~/src/AFLOW. \n\
  - The compilation can be redirected to another path: \n\
      xaflow AWD=/home/src/AFLOW \n\
  - If $(AWD) already exists, it will first move $(AWD) to $(AWD)_OLD. \n\
2. Install the newly compiled executable to your path: \n\
      xaflow install \n\
  - By default, the executable is installed to ~/bin. \n\
  - The installation can be redirected to another path: \n\
      xaflow install ULB=/usr/local/bin \n\
  - As with all makefiles, the AWD and ULB variables can be set simultaneously: \n\
      xaflow install AWD=/home/src/AFLOW ULB=/usr/local/bin \n\
3. Check that aflow is in your path: \n\
      which aflow \n\
  - A returned path means aflow has been successfully installed. \n\
4. Run aflow: \n\
      aflow \n\

GENERAL OVERVIEW \n\
 \n\
The .aflow.rc file is a general configuration file for AFLOW.  \n\
Included in the file are machine-specific paths (VASP executables, pseudopotential files,  \n\
database locations) and general run defaults. \n\
Many of these settings can be overridden by tags in the aflow.in, and even by command line \n\
flags when running AFLOW. \n\
The general priority is as follows: command-line flags, aflow.in tags, and .aflow.rc settings. \n\
The .aflow.rc file is located in your $HOME directory (~/.aflow.rc). \n\
In the event that the file does not exist, AFLOW will generate a new .aflow.rc. \n\
It is a good practice to keep the .aflow.rc file up to date with every new version. \n\
Consider moving ~/.aflow.rc to ~/.aflow.rc_OLD and melding your system modifications. \n\
